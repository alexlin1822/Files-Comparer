Crypto  
Based on Chapter 2 of Information Security (2nd Edition) by Mark Stamp

1. Decrypt the following message that was encrypted using a simple substitution cipher. The plaintext has no spaces or punctuation. (warning: there may be the odd transmission error) Submit the plaintext answer and key, along with an explanation on how you solved the problem and all source code that you developed (use Java, C, or Python) to help you arrive at your answer. The cyphertext is as follows:

PBFPVYFBQXZTYFPBFEQJHDXXQVAPTPQJKTOYQWIPBVWLXTOXBTFXQWAXBVCXQWAXFQJVWLEQNTOZQGGQLFXQWAKVWLXQWAEBIPBFXQVXGTVJVWLBTPQWAEBFPBFHCVLXBQUFEVWLXGDPEQVPQGVPPBFTIXPFHXZHVFAGFOTHFEFBQUFTDHZBQPOTHXTYFTODXQHFTDPTOGHFQPBQWAQJJTODXQHFOQPWTBDHHIXQVAPBFZQHCFWPFHPBFIPBQWKFABVYYDZBOTHPBQPQJTQOTOGHFQAPBFEQJHDXXQVAVXEBQPEFZBVFOJIWFFACFCCFHQWAUVWFLQHGFXVAFXQHFUFHILTTAVWAFFAWTEVOITDHFHFQAITIXPFHXAFQHEFZQWGFLVWPTOFFA

Note, that you will need to write your own code to decrypt the message. Using code or websites available on the Internet or other places to decrypt the message is not allowed. Instead, you should use a large English text corpus from, for example, Wikipedia and do a character frequency analysis on the data as was described in class. Your code should remove spaces, punctuation, and non-alphabetic characters and convert the remaining characters to upper case. Then, your code should do a character frequency analysis on the ciphertext. Explain what you did to recover the plaintext after the two frequency analyses. Submit your data and code along with the key and the recovered plaintext.
