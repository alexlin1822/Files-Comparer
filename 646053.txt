Understanding when the problem of the story starts can set an author straight . <p> Plot points can sometimes be difficult to pick out , especially when there is confusion as to the purpose of such a device in a story . If one accepts the idea that stories are about solving problems , the reason for Inciting Incidents and Act Turns becomes all too clear . <p> Every problem has its own genesis , a moment at which the balance is tipped and the previous sense of oneness is lost . With separation comes the awareness of an inequity , and a desire to return back to a state of parity . Every problem has a solution , and a story explores that process of trying to attain resolution . <p> In a story , this Opening Eventor beginning of a storyis commonly referred to as the Inciting Incident . <h> The Exciting Incident <p> The Inciting Incident ( or " exciting incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event or decision that begins a storys problem . Everything up and until that moment is Backstory ; everything after is " the story . " Before this moment there is an equilibrium , a relative peace that the characters in a story have grown accustomed to . This incisive moment , or plot point occurs and upsets the balance of things . Suddenly there is a problem to be solved . <p> Stories are about solving problems . Sometimes they are solved , as is the case with Star Wars , Casablanca or Inception . Other times , as with stories like Hamlet , Amadeus or Se7en , they are n't  . Regardless of outcome , this Inciting Incident gets the ball rolling by introducing an inequity into the lives of the characters that inhabit the story . The Protagonist seeks the solution , the Antagonist seeks to prevent it . <p> Every story works this way . <h> The Reason for Plot Points <p> The two central objective characters , Protagonist and Antagonist , battle it out until approximately one-quarter of a way into a story , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brand new direction . This second plot point is referred to as the First Act Turn as it turns the story from the First Act into the Second . This is a further development of the problem , not the beginning of a problem . <p> Other plot pointsthe Mid-Point and Second Act Turncontinue to escalate the issues surrounding the efforts to resolve the problem until finally , the Concluding Event , or Final Plot Point , ends the story . As mentioned above , this does not necessarily mean the problem has been solved . It simply means that the efforts that were undertaken by the Protagonist have come to their natural end as every resource has been exhausted . <p> These plot points naturally split a story into four parts . For fans of Aristotle , the first part is the Beginning , the second two are the Middle and the third is the Ending . There is a meaningful reason why there are four parts . In short , for every problem there are four basic contexts from which you can explore the way to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the story is over . Any continuation would simply be a rehash of something that has already been investigated . <p> The most important thing to take away from all of this is that the First Act Turn is NOT the Inciting Incident . This is a common mistake by many first time writers , and is generally caused by a lack of understanding exactly why these plot points exist in the first place . One plot point starts the problems , the other furthers the complications of said problem . <h> Inciting Incidents and First Act Turns <p> The following is a list of great stories with their corresponding Inciting Incidents and First Act Turning Points . The numbers provided are either based on page numbers , Kindle percentages or minutes depending on what source material was easily accessible . <p> For those who do n't  know , the general idea is that one page of a screenplay generally lines up with one minute of screen time . A 120 page screenplay often lasts two hours on screen . or 120 minutes . Thus , the Inciting Incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Act Turn would happen somewhere near page 30 ( out of 120 ) .1 If were talking percentages , that would be about one-quarter of the way into a story . <h> Star Wars <p> The Inciting Incident of Star Wars is Darth Vaders attack on Princess Leias ship ( 1/120 ) . While there was a civil war going on prior to this event , it is n't until the Empire shows its true colors by illegally boarding a ship purported to be on a " diplomatic mission " that the real problems of the story begin . The Empire has grown ruthless in its efforts to contain any rebellion , this inciting event is only the beginning of many more to come . <p> The First Act Turn begins with the Empires sinister agents attack on peaceful Jawas and ends with their barbeque of Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru ( 30-31/120 ) . Suddenly , what began as a simple conflict over jurisdiction has now turned into an all-out rampage that affects even the most remote and more importantly , innocent , members of the galaxy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> The Matrix <p> The Inciting Incident of The Matrix is Morpheus decision that Mr. Andersen is the One they have been looking for ( 2/130 ) . This one decision drives the entire rest of the story , for if he had n't  picked Tom the rest of the world would have stayed comfortably numb in their battery pods . Without the Inciting Incident , there would be no story . <p> The First Act Turn begins with Neos decision to come in off the ledge ( 21/130 ) . It is n't until this true sign of character that Morpheus is forced into taking even greater strides to break poor Mr. Andersen out of the Matrix . These deliberations by Neocontinuing with his " giving the finger " scene , choosing whether or not to stay in the car , and culminating with his decision to take the red pillall create resistance to Morpheus initial selection . It is n't until Neo finally decides that he is the One ( 121/130 ) that the problems in the story come to a successful resolution . <h> Unforgiven <p> The Inciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 5/120 ) . Little Bill is known for dealing with criminals in his own special way , why the sudden change of heart ? His refusal to respond in kind creates a rift within the story at large , and forces the whores to seek out their own justice . The first Act Turning Point only makes matters worse with the arrival of English Bob and his refusal to surrender his sidearms to " proper authority " ( 33/120 ) . <h> The Sixth Sense <p> The Inciting Incident of The Sixth Sense is Vincents attack on Malcom ( 8/109 ) . Without this gunshot , there would be no story and no compulsion for Malcom to meet with Cole . The First Act Turning Point comes with Coles revelation that he might suffer from the same violent tendencies that Vincent did . His steps back and his conclusion that Malcom cant help him only furthers the problems caused by the perception that Cole is merely a " disturbed " child ( 22/109 ) . <h> Casablanca <p> The Inciting Incident of Casablanca is Ugartes decision to give Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of the two couriers seems to get things rolling , problems do n't  really start until Ugarte decides to give them to Rick .

Now we 've got a problem . <p> More than just a " Macguffin " , these papers and the efforts to retrieve become the major source of conflict for everyone involved in the story . This is why Ricks deliberations over what to do with them , including his refusal to help out Ugarte ( " I stick my neck out for nobody " ) , propel the First Act into the Second ( 30-45/127 ) . With Rick in charge of who gets them and when , Laszlos mission becomes that much more difficult . <h> The Lives of Others <p> The Inciting Incident of The Lives of Others is Ministers Hempfs decision to have Georg Dreyman " watched .

Without this bigwigs desire for Dreymans girlfriend , Wiesler would have continued his life as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths with this writer and his friends . <p> Like Casablanca , the First Act Turn comes more as a wave than an actual singular event . This time it is Dreymans best friend , the director Albert Jerska , and his constant ruminations over the purpose of his life that progressively complicate a simple spy operation into something far more reaching and grander in scope . Jerskas dark contemplations of suicide inspire Dreyman to write and give reason for Wiesler to better understand the kind of struggles and torment these artists go through as a result of the states actions . <h> The Incredibles <p> And finally , the Inciting Incident of The Incredibles occurs with the overwhelming flood of lawsuits stemming from Mr. Incredibles loss in court against Oliver Sansweet , the man he rescued from suicide ( 14/127 ) . This rush to sue forces the Supers into hiding , promising " to never again resume hero work . " These previously costumed guys ( and girls ) now ca n't be who they want to be , and thus yet another story inequity has been created . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have simmered down . The flood of lawsuits tipped the scales . <p> Problems escalate when Bob and Frozone almost get caught during the fire in the apartment building sequence ( 32/127 ) . Before , Bob had found a way to deal with the initial problem by moonlighting with his best friend . This event , and their near apprehension by local authorities , forces Frozone to decide that this night was the last one . What was once a manageable problem has now become an even bigger one , and eventually provides the motivation for Bob to accept the mysterious invitation from Mirage . <p> Plot points drive a story towards the resolution of its problem . <h> Not Just About Movies <p> But what about other forms of narrative fiction ? Surely this is just a " formula " for Hollywood-wannabes to follow <p> Story is story regardless of the delivery device . <p> The Inciting Incident of Shakespeares Hamlet is the death of Hamlets father . As with The Matrix , where the actual inciting event happens " off-screen " , the story immediately opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> HAMLET : Let me not think ont ! Frailty , thy name is woman A little month , or ere those shoes were old With which she followd my poor fathers body Like Niobe , all tearswhy she , even she O God ! a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mournd longer <p> Quick tranlsation : Hamlet has been thrown into great despair because of his mothers impulsive move to quickly marry his fathers brother , Claudius ( 10% ) . The fact that she could n't even wait a month drives Hamlet mad , thus creating a problem in Elsinore that calls for some sort of resolution . This problem grows in importance when the Ghost of Hamlets father informs his son of what really happened : <p> No longer an inequity that must be suffered , the death of Hamlets father now becomes something that must be avenged ( 20% ) . The dramatic energy produced by the news of his fathers passing has waned to the point where something new must come along and drive the story further towards its inevitable conclusion . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event , and can be considered the First Act Turning Point of the play . <h> Problems , Energy , and Plot Points <p> Determining the events or decisions that escalate a storys problem should be Job One for the working dramatist . It is one thing to create an opening scene that wreaks havoc on the characters in the film and forces them to deal with this new problem , quite another to ensure that the inequity persists until the closing curtain . <p> Eventually , as with Hamlet , the potential for dramatic conflict will decline throughout the course of an Act . It is the same drop in potential that one feels as the pain from a pinch or slap in the face subsides over time . In order for the problem of a story to continue to drive the characters towards an eventual solution , a new potential must be introduced . These new dramatic forces , escalating the problem beyond that initial blast , drive the story forward in such a way that the characters themselves could never return to who they were or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no turning back . <p> Act turns exist to re-energize the potential of a storys problem , not to satisfy page-counting readers or paradigm-happy script gurus . Connecting the two first plot points to this problem , and making sure that they are n't  simply the same event , will give an audience something to engage in and something to become invested in . The fact of the matter is that no audience member can resist the draw of the problem solving process as it unfolds on the big screen ; its human nature to see what greater meaning can be gained from how the resolution plays out . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Structurally , Dramatica calls for four Acts , or Signposts , in every complete story . Experientially ( from the audiences viewpoint ) , the Journeys between these Signposts are the Three Acts that most people ( Aristotle included ) feel when they watch or read a story . The Inciting Incident and First Act Turn surround that First Signpost on either side . Dramatica smartly calls these plot points Story Drivers . <p> The problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent mark is that , from a dramatic perspective , there is little energy being spent during that first act . Typically , stories without a strong Inciting Incident also , by matter of definition , have no definable problem in place for the characters to deal with . Thus , no conflict and little for the audience to be concerned with . Waiting until the quarter mark to get things going is a surefire way towards creating a storytelling disaster . <p> The Inciting Incident exists , not because McKee calls for it , but because it creates that inequity in the lives of the characters within a story . There has to be some impetus for all that follows , some problem that needs to be solved . The Story Driver manufactures this problem . <p> And yes , I do mean page ZERO . In a perfect , computer generated world the Inciting Incident of a story would happen on page 0 , with the following Act Turns happening every 25% . Thankfully , we do n't  live in such a world . ? ?

Those who hold onto it are robbing themselves of the opportunity to create unique stories that defy convention . <p> As stated in my linked item concerning The Confusion Between Main Character and Protagonist , the idea that these two concepts are one and the same is an outdated notion from yesteryear . While there are several films and stories where the two are masterfully combined , there is a relatively unexplored and misunderstood area that seeks to create unique meaning by separating the two . <p> To Kill A Mockingbird , The Terminator , The Counterfeiters ( Die Falscher ) , The Shawshank Redemption , and The Lives of Others ( Des Leben der Anderen ) are just a few of the many wonderful stories that have Main Characters who do not drive the story forward.Influence Charactern this article , well be taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the sheen . <h> Defining Goals <p> Before determining the Protagonist of the story , it helps to first define what the Story Goal is . The Story Goal is something everyone in the story is concerned with . The successful achievement of this goal will resolve the storys central problem . This problem is presented early on in a story and disrupts the natural balance of things . <p> In The Shawshank Redemption , problems in the story exist because an innocent man has been unjustly incarcerated . Without Andys innocence there is no problem and thus , no story . This problem affects everyone from the warden to the hardest screw to the inmates and so on . Once Andy is freed , the problems in the story will be resolved and the story will be over . This is the Goal of the story freeing an innocent man . <p> In The Lives of Others , problems in the story exist because a jealous state official wants dirt , real or imagined , on a potentially subversive writer . This problem affects everyone from the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Secret Police captain assigned to his case . If the truth about this writer remains a mystery , then the story will be resolved and the story will be over . <h> Defining Protagonists <p> The Protagonist is defined as the character pursuing the Story Goal . In Shawshank , this responsibility lies in Andy . Though we do n't  know it until much later , he spends a lot of his time digging a giant hole and preparing everything for his eventual escape . <p> The Antagonist is defined as the character preventing the Story Goal . Warden Norton ( Bob Gunton ) fulfills this role . He s the one preventing Andy from escaping and gives him plenty of opportunities to rethink his escape plans ( throwing him in the hole , shooting Tommy , etc . ) . This is another property of the Antagonist , his or her drive to get others to Reconsider their actions ( For more on the characteristics of Archetypal Characters like this , please read my article Character Motivation Defined ) . <p> In The Lives of Others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lazlo " for you Casablanca fans ! ) and the Antagonist is the jealous state official , Minister Hempf . Georg is constantly pursuing a course of action wherein his blacklisted friends ( director Albert Jerska ) can have an opportunity to make their art . Hempf does everything in his power to prevent him , including stealing away his girlfriend , Christa-Maria Sieland . <h> Identifying the Main Character <p> But in both these films we do n't  experience the events that happen through the eyes of their respected Protagonists . The Main Character is defined as the character through whose eyes we experience the story . We never get to feel what it is like to be in that hole for a month with Andy . We see him go in . And we see him come out . When he plays the music over the loudspeaker , were not in there with him , were experiencing it from outside .

While he does supply the dramatic function of Narrator , there are deep thematic issues going on within Red that we are personally privy too as well . We are emotionally invested in his journey , due in no small part to the particular shot selections made by Darabont and his crew . In fact , whenever Red makes that long walk to his parole hearings , we the audience assume his position . Those P.O.V. shots are a clear indicator that the filmmakers themselves considered this character the one the audience should empathize with the most . <p> The same could be said for The Lives of Others and the Main Character of that film , Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler ( brilliantly portrayed by Ulrich M++he ) . We are emotionally invested in him because again , we are privy to things about him that many others in the story do n't  know ( his pathetic and secluded home life , the hidden looks on his face as he listens in to the conversations below , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped around whether or not people like him ( the Stasi ) can change . <h> Meaning and Accuracy <p> And the emotional meaning behind The Shawshank Redemption is also wrapped around whether or not Red can change . He is more than just the one telling the story . Through him we get to feel what it is like to have become " institutionalized " and a person who has lost all hope . Likewise , in The Lives of Others we get to feel what is like to be someone struggling with the negative labels people ascribe to us . As a member of the Secret Police , Wiesler knows many consider him a " bad man . " The emotional meaning of the story lies in whether or not he can resolve these personal issues . <p> This is why it is important to separate out the concepts of Protagonist and Main Character .

Sure , they can be combined as they have been in many great stories ( Up In The Air , The Wrestler , The Silence of the Lambs , Braveheart , The Godfather , and so on ) , but to require that they must always be one and the same is to discount the subtle and beautifully complex emotional arguments that are being made by films like The Shawshank Redemption and The Lives of Others .

These are fantastic stories that are on the top of every Top 100 list . Non-transformative growth can be a powerful means of expressing an authors point-of-view . <p> Again , understanding the difference between growth and change is the key .

There is no specialized structure for a two-act play anymore than there is one for a Saturday morning cartoon . Assuming that the purpose of narrative fiction is to create some greater meaning that we can not experience in our own life , the process to deliver that meaning will always be the same . <p> The Dramatica theory of storythe most accurate model of story available todayis based on the premise that every complete story is really an analogy for the human minds problem-solving process . When a film or novel deviates from this process , whether it be through a missed plot progression or inconsistent character motivation , the audience instantly picks up on it because each and every one of them has their own mind . They are all intimately aware of this process . They are all experts in story . <h> Different Minds , Different Stories <p> Regardless though of the similarities between how everyone is constructed , no two human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiosyncrasies , their own way of going about things and their own take on the issues affecting them . Everyone is unique . The same can be said of complete stories . <p> The psychotic mind at the center of Se7en is completely different than the pop princess mind that is The Little Mermaid . Both operate under the same process and the same dynamic forces , yet their personalities and the way they go about solving problems couldnt be more different . The reason they both found success with their individual audiences is because they both honored the analogy between story and mind . <h> The Analogy Revealed <p> What good can come from classifying stories as an analogy to the human mind ? Well , for starters , the reason why Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre ever came into existence becomes clear . <p> Characters were developed as a means of expressing the motivations within the human mind . Just as there are motivations within a single mind to solve a problem , delay it , or avoid it all together , so too are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Plot came about as a natural representation of the methodologies that the human mind explores in solving problems . The various strategies and approaches taken within a story perfectly mimic the actions and reactions the mind employs . <p> Theme , often seen as the measuring stick with which to judge the characters and the actions they take , was developed as a need to express the evaluations the human mind undergoes . Determining whether the process is worth continuing or whether or not to trust how things are changing are natural processes everyone experiences in their own lives millions of times a day . In a story , Theme assumes that mechanism . <p> And finally , Genre was created as a way of expressing the purpose behind a minds attempt to solve a problem . Typically Genre is viewed in light of its category on Netflix or in iTunes - Romantic Comedy , War Drama , Action/Adventure , and so on . But seen in the context of the human mind solving a problem it becomes apparent that these genres are really aiming at a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fast-paced editing , Period Pieces aim to inform while also exploring human relationships over the centuries . The Genre specifies the purpose . <p> Put together , each part combines to create a meaningful model of the human mind at work . Each part combines to create a complete story . <h> Slicing the Short Story <p> But when it comes to stories that are shorter in length , it becomes impossible to explore the whole thing . There simply is n't enough time to go down every avenue and accurately depict the entirety of the human mind at work . <p> But Authors can take a slice . <p> The key is to give the audience just enough of the taste of the " mind " of a story that they become hooked , seeing an Author as someone they can trust to give them the kind of meaning they go to stories for . Authors could simply focus on Character , insuring that the central character develops over time , growing to an eventual meaningful resolution . Or they could simply offer up a slice of Plot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four Acts . They could even cross-cut their piece , taking a bit of Character , Plot , Theme and Genre with it in an attempt to provide a glimpse of something greater just beyond . <p> This latter approach is taken in John Augusts wildly entertaining story , The Variant . In the short span of 23 pages , August delivers a combination of all four aspects of story that hints at something deeply meaningful . In essence , it is the final set piece of a potentially engaging complete story . Take for example , this one Amazon review , typical of many : <p> 25 pages of on your edge ca n't wait to read next line thriller . At the end you 're left with the feeling of more , I want more . Give me more John . You want the whole story , what happens next .

The hints of natural character growth and a clear-cut ending that actually means something , tantalizes the human mind into desiring even more . <p> Another great example of this slicing occurs in Scott Franks short story , The Flying Kreisslers . Here , Frank focuses on delivering four very clear Acts , a slice of Plot that delivers the feeling of a complete story . Because there is n't enough fictional real estate to explore every aspect of the human mind at work , Frank chooses to fixate his narrative on the Main Characters throughline , tracking the development of Ivans journey from manipulated to manipulator . In less than 2000 words , he delivers a sense of completeness , a savory morsel that honors the minds natural problem-solving process . <h> One Bite and Youre Hooked <p> Audiences crave meaning . In the case of the short story , they want an Author to respect them by sampling just enough of that greater picture that they get the idea that there could be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembles their own . Audiences leave insulted when there is no attempt at crafting something worthwhile . If Authors wish their short stories to become cherished works they would do well to investigate how to apply the minds problem-solving process through Character , Plot , Theme and Genre . 
@@119272643 @8272643/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> The Pacific vs . Band of Brothers <p> Historical narrative fiction , especially war drama , often seeks to find meaning in events that at times can seem meaningless . By employing proper story structure strategies , writers can find success in communicating a message that both enlightens and pays respect to those who sacrificed it all . <p> Watching The Pacific marathon on HBO this past Memorial Day weekend , it became clear the major difference between the latest WWII miniseries from Spielberg and Hanks and their first go-round , Band of Brothers . While many may cite the disjointed storytelling of The Pacific as a basis for claiming it inferior to Band of Brothers , the real reason for the disharmony between the two lies within the type of story each was trying to tell . One was decidedly up , the other was almost certainly a downer . In matters of real life , audiences are more receptive of the former , often steering clear of the latter if they can . <h> The Miniseries vs . Feature Film <p> Feature films are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own as an audience can receive the writers original message without any greater context . The miniseries is an entirely different animal . <p> In order to completely understand the writers original intent , critical judgment must be put on hold until every episode has played out . One would n't analyze a film after only seeing forty percent of it , and thus should avoid analyzing a ten-part series by only watching the first four episodes . Understanding can not come from an incomplete message . <h> Stand-alone Episode <p> Sometimes though , there can be individual episodes within a series that can stand on their own as a complete story . The X-Files was well known for this with their " monster " shows . These were episodes that had nothing to do with the over-arching alien conspiracy mythos that propelled that series for nine years . An audience member could conceivably sit down , and without having watched a single minute before , enjoy a well-told and complete story . Milagro is a good example of this kind of episode . <p> In Band of Brothers , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered stand-alone episodes . In particular " Bastogne " , the episode that focused on the medic as the Main Character , told a complete story in less than an hour . <p> As the man responsible for fixing up the wounded on the front-line , medic Roe ( Shane Taylor ) has developed a defensive technique that distances himself emotionally from his fellow soldier . Through his interactions with the nurse Renee , Roe eventually grows to a point where he can allow the men in , even calling one of them by his first name . Its a beautiful story that satisfies the need for on-screen warfare , while also fulfilling an audiences need for emotional growth . It works on its own , and is often the one episode people return to when they want to revisit the European front . <p> The Pacific , unfortunately , did not find time to do this . Unfortunate in that detours of storytelling like this allow an audience a breather within the larger scope of the series , while at the same time bringing in more audience members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was any major complaint to be had about the series , this lack of at least one standalone episode would be it ( something I was really hoping for way back in September of 2009 , when I linked to The Best Band of Brothers episode ) . <h> Linear Progression of Events <p> Another significant difference between the two series lies with something that was beyond the control of the writersthe two theaters of war were vastly unalike . The road to Berlin was a very linear undertaking , starting with Normandy and ending on Hitlers doorstep . In contrast , the war against the Japanese Empire was full of starts and stops , fall backs and huge leaps forward . There was no set discernable path , and this is where The Pacific had trouble holding on to its primary audience : men . <p> Male audiences empathize more easily with linear experiences than they do with holistic experiences . They would much rather experience a journey with discernible signposts and clear demonstrable benchmarks that lead towards an eventual outcome . This is where Band of Brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its intended audience finds greater harmony with the presentation . <p> The Pacific , on the other hand , sought to provide an audience with an experience of this theater in its entirety . This involved short reprises in Australia and war bond drives in America . It involved more women and focused on the relationships back home and abroad that the men developed . Because of this approach , the writers lost a large portion of its audience after only four short episodes . The linearity of the journey was not as clear as it had been with Band of Brothers . <h> The Endings <p> But when it comes right down to it , the greatest difference between these two miniseries was the meaning of their individual endings . Referencing last years series on Meaningful Endings , one can determine the authors original intent of a piece of narrative fiction by comparing where the Main Character ends up emotionally with the logistical outcome of the main story line . <p> If the good guys win and the Main Character goes home happy , the story can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good guys win and the Main Character goes home distraught , the story is a Personal Tragedy . If the good guys lose and the Main Character is left resolved , the story is a Personal Triumph . And finally , good guys lose and Main Character remains troubled , the story is a Tragedy . <p> Both series ended with the good guys winning , which of course , was historically accurate . But when it came to the Main Character storylines , the two couldnt be more different . <p> In Band of Brothers , the Main Character of the series was Maj. Richard D. Winters ( Damian Lewis ) . Through ten episodes we witness the struggles and concerns of a commanding officer , made even more personal through his interactions with his closest friend , Captain Lewis Nixon ( Ron Livingston ) . At the end , Winters returns home scarred , but has resolved any major personal issues he may have had with the job he did . Band of Brothers was a Triumph storythe good guys won and the Main Character returned home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the series was Eugene B. Sledge ( Joseph Mazzello ) . There were two other primary characters who received ample screentime , Robert Leckie and John Basilone , but when taken as a whole these feel more like sub-stories rather than the main feature . Sledges descent into madness was the key storyline of the series . <p> Sledges concern , as voiced by his father , was living through the war with his soul intact . Starting with the landing on Peleliu , the horror of war slowly chips away at his humanity . Furthering this fall is the mortarman he develops a significant relationship with , Merriel " Snafu " Shelton ( Rami Malek ) . As a veteran of previous engagements , Snafu has developed his own way of dealing with the madness among the coralhe has learned to embrace life without a soul . The emotional argument then , as presented by this series , comes down to which one of them will eventually adopt the others perspective . <p> In the end , it is Sledge who holds on to that last sliver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , he still returns home shattered . Unable to find work anywhere with the job skills he acquired overseas , Sledge finds himself lost and confused ; a broken man . The Pacific was a Personal Tragedy storyalthough the good guys won , the Main Character returned home broken and lost . <p> This was the main reason people preferred Band of Brothers over The Pacific ; the experience was more uplifting . Both series place us on a winning team , but only one provides that emotional resolution . There is nothing inherently wrong with either structure , in fact some prefer the closer-to-real life experience of the Personal Tragedy . <h> Different Titles <p> Whether it was the lack of standalone episodes , the non-linearity approach of the plot , or the lack of emotional resolution in the Main Characters storyline , The Pacific falls short of gaining the universal love Band of Brothers enjoyed . Structure has an impact on how a story is received . Its not just a set of rules designed to get writers past the studio readers . There is meaning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged and writers should be aware of the impact the order of events and juxtaposition of outcomes has on an audience . <p> One must not look any further than the titles of these two miniseries in order to understand the vast differences between the two . Band of Brothers focused more on the deep emotional bonds these men developed under intense fighting conditions . The camaraderie was a key component . The Pacific , on the other hand , was all about experiencing that very different theater of war . Here , the environments toil on the human condition was the centerpiece . The madness of fighting for small islands that in reality could have been skipped over is a key point in the overall purpose of the series . <p> In communicating the events of the Pacific theater , the writers intended to depict the very real effect war has on the human soul . As Sledges father says in the very first episode regarding returning veterans , " It was n't that they had their flesh torn , but that they had their souls torn out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific took the greater risk .

With feature films becoming epic rollercoaster rides of spandex and spectacle , vibrant kiddie fare and immature thematic explorations , the television series grants fans of narrative an opportunity to become lost in meaningful complexity . The long-form story promises fulfillment ; the long-form story demands a form to story . <p> I 'm often asked what is the best way to structure a television series . Should I create one storyform for the entire series ? Do I create storyforms for each episode ? The answer is yes . You do both , and you do more . <p> The Dramatica storyform is a collection of seventy-five different storypoints that work in tandem to create a holistic image of a storys deep underlying meaning . When a narrative shows signs of " holes " or underdeveloped characters , chances are the storyform is brokenor missing key parts . Working as an analogy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message and gives purpose to their work . <h> The Best Way to Plan It Out <p> While many different paths exist on the road to planning out a successful series , the best seems to be to follow The X-Files model . For those unfamiliar with the series , the shows episodes fell into two different categories : Mythology and Monster . The Mythology episodes covered the grand story of alien cover-up and government conspiracy . The Monster episodes took a break from the conspiracy to focus on the creature-of-the-week . Beyond the Sea and Clyde Bruckmans Final Respose work well as stand-alone Monster episodescomplete stories in their own right . <p> To achieve this balance , you create one master Storyform for the " Mythology " of your series , and then individual Storyforms for the " Monster " episodes . Anytime you want a certain context to feel complete , you should create a storyform . If you want each season finale of your series to have the same kind of impact the finales of Game of Thrones have had , you should even go so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For the Disney animated television series Tangled : Before Ever After I recently consulted on , we created one master Storyform for the entire Series . We then created individual storyforms for each Season . While writing the detailed outline for the first season , I tried to incorporate and blend story points from the Series Storyform and the Season Storyform within different episodes . In addition , I tried to keep the outline open to allow for an entire Storyform within one episode . This helps to break things up and avoid the monotony of telling the same story over and over again . It also helped create a congruency of purpose in the storytelling . <p> In short , the thing held together . <h> Implementing Different Storyforms <p> One storyform for the entire series . One for each season . And then an occasional storyform here and there for a single episode . Depending on the nature of your series , you may need to create a storyform for every episodeparticularly if you want each to feel complete and wholebut you certainly do n't  have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that you 're writing True Detective and you only want one storyform for one season . And then you move on to a completely different storyform for the next season . Perfectly fine , and apparently quite successful . <p> let 's say you take the time to design a separate story form for Act 1 ( or season one ) , which is about Understanding ( or misunderstanding ) . You would make Truth , Evidence , Suspicion , and Falsehood the four signposts in the overall throughline for this act . If you turn to the Plot Sequence report for this act , it will break down Truth into four stages . Same with the others . Now you have story goals for 16 issues within this Act . Repeat for the other acts and that 's enough for 64 issues . <p> Story goals but not really Story Goals in the Dramatica sense . The 64 issues here assume the role of simple subject matter rather than work with others as viable story points within a larger context . The result is confusion on the part of those trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Best to keep it simple and decide the number of episodes you want to see working as a complete story ; then craft a storyform to guide them . <p> Blending various storyforms is not exact science ; you will miss out on some story points here and there . The overall sense of the series will be this notion that there is something grander going on . Audiences will latch on to your series because theyll be able to tell that you 're not winging it . Your series will have purpose . <h> When a Signpost is a Season <p> For Tangled , we made plans for three seasons . Season One took care of the first Signpost from the Series Storyform . Season Two took Signposts Two and Three and the last Season assumed responsibility for Signpost Four . It would have been nicer and cleaner if the series made arrangements for four seasons , but unfortunately I do n't  get paid to make those kinds of decisions.2 <p> Coincidentally , the Overall Story Concern for the Season One storyform matched the Overall Story Signpost One for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  need to do this , but I think it helped keep everything that was happening within Season One relevant within the greater context of the entire Series . The process of writing the outline for that first Season felt like a natural extension of telling a grander story . <p> The Overall Story Concern for Season Two matches the 2nd Signpost of the Series Storyform , falling in line with the pattern set up with the first Season . Unfortunately , I 'm not sure how that will pan out in the second half of Season Two . The easier fix would be to split that season into two . If the show is successful as it appears it will be , that may indeed be what happens . But again , I 'm not in charge . <h> Maintaining the Integrity of the Storyform <p> The hardest part of this process is keeping everyone on track with each of the storyforms you worked out . Egos being what they are , eventually the whole process breaks down without someone in charge knowing and completely understanding the purpose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how someone can possibly know exactly what is supposed to happen 2/3 of the way into the story . And not just the general Dark Night of the Soul baloney , but specific character interactions and key character development points . They just do n't  get it , and thus rebel and rewrite and essentially tear down all the hard work . As a consultant you can only influence and encourage creatives to keep in line with the original intent and purpose behind a story . The rest is up to the process . <p> If you 're writing the whole thing yourself , you 're golden and the above process should work wonders for you . Another client of mine is doing this very same thing and she is rocking the final result . People familiar with her work are blown away by how well the latest draft of her series is structured and thought out . If you want to see monumental changes in your work , give your story a purposegive it a storyform . <p> Or two , or three . <p> Any excuse to keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Write a Book Now with Dramatica . ? ? <p> Someday I 'll explain how I had to fight for Signpost Three within that second Season .

Yet , while following in the footsteps of their legacy brings visual success , maintaining the companys unique brand of storytelling does not . <p> Face itthe Disney classics of old ( pre the Little Mermaid ) were not great stories . They were tales . Mid 20th-century audiences , familiar with many of these tales and comfortable with the relative simplicity of the linear events , took to these films with ease and comfort . Audiences filled in many of the story holes with their own knowledge of these tales and brandished little complaint . <p> This is n't to say those films werent charming , or that they werent packed with sincere honest character moments . <p> They simply werent stories . <p> Tangled suffers from the same fate . Tales lay out a simple linear plot progression : this happens , then this happens , then this happens , the end . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing where the characters began with where they ended up . Cut the journey off earlier or let it prolong a little while and the final destination shifts . Different resting spot , different meaning . <h> A Purpose for Storytelling <p> Stories , on the other hand , present arguments . Through the machinations of character , plot , theme and genre an Author argues that one particular approach fares better or worse than another while solving a particular problem . Cutting the journey shorter or making it longer may change the ending , but it wont change what the story means . Within this process , story points resonate throughout the piece into one large holistic purpose . The key to providing this experience lies in consistency and a clear structural basis . <p> In all , there are four major areas where Tangled breaks this process : <p> Unclear Main Character <p> Both Principle Characters Change <p> No Protagonist <p> No Consequence <p> Unraveling these story issues should help clarify the difference between a story and a tale , and hopefully suggest ways to avoid any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about Rapunzelso how can one possibly argue that the Main Character was unclear ? Quite simply , it is never clear to the Audience whose shoes they are supposed to be standing in . At times we see the film from Rapunzels viewpoint . Other times we feel like we are riding along with Flynn , empathizing with his plight . The filmmakers themselves even felt this duality , as evidenced by the opening narration that tells you in no uncertain terms know whose story this is . <p> Now , narration by itself does not determine a Main Character point-of-view . There are instances of narration that are objective and do not involve an Audience into personal issues central to that experience . In To Kill A Mockingbird , Scout narrates the story as an adult , not as her younger Main Character self . In The Usual Suspects , Verbal Kint ( Kevin Spacey ) relates the events of days gone past , yet manages to hold back key information . Tangled on the other hand , provides us much more through the eyes of its narrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this movie . There is the Flynn who agrees to take Rapunzel out and challenges her status as a locked-away princess . And then there is the Flynn who steals the crown , yet ultimately gives it up for love . The former operates properly as an Influence Character to Rapunzels Main Character . The latter works as Main Character . We do n't  see Flynns struggle from afar , we experience firsthandup close and personalthe very definition of a Main Character . <p> Whether or not this came as a result of marketing influences determined to appeal to a broader Male audience ( the film , after all used to be called Rapunzel ) or as a result of several different and competing visions matters little . The final analysis remains the same : Audiences were confused as to whose side of the argument they were supposed to be on . <h> Both Characters Change <p> Pile on this grave mistake with the unfortunate reality that both Rapunzel and Flynn philosophically change their point-of-views . If both principle characters change , all meaning is lost . <p> Story works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's nothing you can do or say to change my mind . Another character comes along and challenges the first by saying Oh yeah , well you 're looking in the wrong place because I believe this and there 's no way I 'm going to change my mind . The two battle it out back and forth until ultimately one gives in and changes over to the others point-of-view . Match this change with whether or not that decision was right or wrong and the Author has crafted a Meaningful Ending . In this way , The Author has proved , or argued , the appropriateness of one approach over another . <p> When both characters shift their point-of-view , nothing is being said . As an Audience we cant tell what the Author was trying to say with their work . <p> That 's a recipe for disaster . <p> Again , the Flynn who agrees to take Rapunzel out and falls in love with her is not the same Flynn who steals in the beginning then ultimately gives up that very same chase for the crown . The first Flynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And so does Rapunzel . <p> She wants nothing more than to leave , yet gives that up once she sees Flynn floating away . Yet moments later Flynn begins to change , culminating with his final show of sacrifice . So then which change is more appropriate ? Who was in the right ? What are the Authors trying to say ? Its nice and sweet , but it really does n't  add up to anything in the end . <p> That dynamic of one character , or viewpoint , remaining steadfast while another character gravitates towards them defines the very core of a story . Obfuscate it with dual shifts and the audience will leave the theater confused and disappointed . <h> No Protagonist <p> Wait a second , you may be thinking , Did n't  you just explain how Tangled couldnt decide whether Flynn or Rapunzel was the Main Character ? Does n't  that mean there were two Protagonists ? <p> No . <p> Main Characters are not automatically Protagonists . In the past those two terms were used interchangeably , but recent discoveries call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to distinguish between the point-of-view that is the Main Character and the objective character function of the Protagonist . <p> A Main Character provides the first person point-of-view for the Audience . The Protagonist is the character in pursuit of the Overall Story Goal . Now sometimes these two are one in the same , as in Star Wars , Drive , or Midnight in Paris . Other times they are not , as in the aforementioned To Kill A Mockingbird or The Terminator . <p> As established previously , Tangled clearly supplies the Main Character point-of-view whether through Rapunzel or Flynn . But who is the Protagonist and what are they after ? What is the Story Goal ? <p> If Rapunzel is the Protagonist then the Goal must be for her to see the lights . Yet this happens about 2/3 into the movie . Once the Goal is reached , the story is over . This is part of the definition of a Story Goal . <p> Besides , that Goal really does n't  classify as an Overall Story Goal as much as it does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds themselves overly concerned with finding those lights ? An Overall Story Goalthe kind a Protagonist chases aftersits as a concern for everyone in the story . It is an objective Goal that everyone is either for or against . <p> In this case , it becomes clear that the Goal of the story is to reunite the lost princess with her kingdom . Princess comes home and the inequity is resolved , the story is over . <p> But who is pursuing this Goal ? <p> Certainly not the King or Queen . Sure they send up lights once a year , but beyond that ? There really is n't anyone . The setup feels slightly lopsided as it is quite clear who the Antagonist is . Mother Gothel does whatever she can to prevent her gold mine from returning home . Is there even an objective character who could qualify as standing up against her in pursuit of this Goal ? <p> Rapunzel eventually reaches this point , but far too along in the story for it to balance out the argument properly . Protagonists need to be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve it . That knowledge and the ensuing pursuit must be there in order for the storys argument to work . Otherwise the story comes off half-baked and unrealized . Rapunzel is neither aware nor consistent in her approach the way a Protagonist must be . <p> Thus , there is no Protagonist . <h> No Consequence <p> Adding further insult to energy , the film fails to correctly encode a Consequence . <p> No wonder there is n't a Protagonist ! <p> Every Story Goal needs a Consequence . Whether it is the fear of having to live under tyranny in Star Wars or fighting the impulse to destroy a giant metal robot in Iron Giant , there must be a negative repercussion in place if the efforts towards the Story Goal fail . Why else would a Protagonist be driven to pursue if there was n't something there motivating them ( and the other characters for that matter ) ? <p> What are the consequences of the lost princess not returning home in Tangled ? Sure there is sadness . But only once a year , and even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying on ! There is no Protagonist to be found because each and everyone of the kingdoms citizens gave up a long time ago . <p> There was nothing motivating them to make a difference . <h> Striving for Something More <p> With no Consequence , there is nothing driving a Protagonist , thus no need to include one within a story . With no Protagonist there is no outcome that can be meaningfully juxtaposed against the Main Characters final resolve to change or remain steadfast . Without a concrete resolve it does n't  really matter who the Main Character is , and thus no anchor point for an Audience member . No anchor point , no empathy , no Audience buy in . <p> No Audience buy in , no Audience buyingtickets . <p> This is n't to say there are n't  those who enjoy the film . In fact , many have found Tangled more enjoyable the second or third time around . Unfortunately this is because they have given up on gaining any appreciable meaning out of the film and instead simply enjoy the visual candy . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be the filmmakers were content with simply telling a tale of old , and that 's fine . Unfortunately audiences today crave more than a simple collection of events mashed up together in an ordered list . If they wanted that , theyd visit their Twitter stream . <p> Audiences want meaning . They want a reason for leaving their houses and sitting in that theater . They want an experience and a purpose to their viewing experience . They want something more than stereo-vision . They want to live in a moment they cant recreate on their own . <p> Stories can do this . They can fulfill the promise audiences expect from a movie by engaging their minds with purpose .

Inception is one such story . <h> Of Protagonists and Main Characters <p> Fear not , this is n't going to be yet another exploration of why the Protagonist is not always the Main Character .

One throughline provides a first-person intimate look at resolving the story 's problem , the other provides a detached third-person objective view of the story 's problem . Offered an insight into both , we are given the opportunity to gather some greater meaning from the storys events . <p> On the one hand , Cobb is the Protagonistthe character pursuing the Story Goal that affects everyone in the story . On the other hand , Cobb is also the Main Charactera man reeling from the guilt he feels for the part he played in his wifes suicide . <p> So is the Story Goal simply Cobb getting back home to his children ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ? <h> The Inequity Created by the Inciting Incident <p> The Inciting Incident of a story creates an inequity within the lives of the characters in the story . In Inception , this moment occurs when Cobb accepts the job from Saito effectively creating the inequity , or Big Dramatic Question , that propels the conflict to follow . Is inception possible ? Answering this question thus becomes the main thrust of the Overall Story throughline . <p> This is why the Story Goal of Inception can not simply be Cobb returning home to his family . It is an essential part of his Main Character throughline , but in terms of Protagonist and Overall Story , the Goal he is pursuing has everything to do with planting that idea in Fischers head . <h> Keeping the Plot Points Consistent <p> Furthermore , the Inciting Incident and Concluding Event ( the plot point that brings a story to a close ) must be of the same type . Deciding to take Saito up on his offer is a decision . Returning home to his kids is an action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plot points can be one of two thingsactions or decisions . In a well-told story one will be seen as the driver of the other . The order of events has meaning . Learning to be an expert jewelry thief so that you can become fabulously wealthy carries an entirely different meaning than getting stinking rich so you can afford to learn to be a jewelry thief . Thus , plot points must remain consistent as they contribute to the overall meaning of a story . <p> Thankfully , in Inception they are . <p> Cobb decides to take Saito up on his bargain and Fischer decides to break up his fathers empire . The first creates the inequity . The second ( and last ) resolves it . Not only does it bring a successful close to Cobbs mission as Protagonist , but also it clearly answers the question of whether or not inception was even possible . <p> But there was even more meaning behind Fischers revelation . <h> Wherein It Is Revealed Why This Movie Was So Big <p> What was it about this movie that kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of how greater self-awareness can successfully resolve the problems we face in our own lives . <p> From a third person Objective point-of-view ( that " A " storyline ) , we get to see how Fischers own self-awareness of his place within his fathers world successfully brings their mission to a close . Saitos own self-awareness of some " half-remembered dream " ties into this as well . <p> From a more intimate Subjective point-of-view ( that " personal " storyline ) , we get to see how Cobbs self-realization that the projection of his wife could never match up to the real thing resolves the angst he began the story with . This emotional catharsis ultimately relieves him from the pain of guilt in the same way that Fischers decision relieves everyone from the storys main inequity . It is why Cobb can walk away from the spinning top and embrace his kids regardless of whether or not they are real or not .

Why ? <p> The Impact Character Throughlinethe throughline that forces Cobb to undergo his transformation of characterseems less well defined than the Main Character and Overall Story Throughlines . Ostensibly it is fulfilled by Ariadne , but there is a significant amount of handing-off going on between her and Cobbs wife , Mal . This is where the complaints about the film feeling " cold " or emotionally distant come into play . Without an effectively strong Impact Character , the Relationship Story Throughlinethe relationship between the Main and Impact Charactersuffers . This fourth throughline is where the heart of every story lies and where Inception possibly falls short . <p> There are inklings of it being fulfilled , especially in the beginning scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with Ariadne to draft one . But this key component of story falls by the wayside as the Overall Story Throughline steps in .

The dissonance between the dual solutions of Self-Aware leading to both an Outcome of Success and a Judgment of Good rocket this film beyond any other film this Summer .

Hopps prefers to solve her problems externally first ( joining the police academy , serving up parking tickets with gusto ) and grows by adopting a new characteristic rather than by letting a bad one fall by the wayside . <p> I think this latter is on purposeits not like the filmmakers wanted to portray her as an active racist . Her prejudice is subtle and sublime ; its not like she is going out and lynching foxes for what they did to her . That would be a Stop character .

But stories are not supposed to be about catching bad guys , especially a story as sophisticated in its structure as Zootopia . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film . Like Pixars Ratatouillewhich suffered the same exact problem of sophistication with a broken Story Limitthe film slows down and loses focus as the audience realigns what they thought the film was supposed to be about with what it obviously will be about . <p> The reveal of Bellwether as bad guy is a foregone conclusion . Of course she is behind it all . And not because its a storytelling trope that migrated down from the Bay Area . No , everyone knows it is coming because that is the only option left . It simply becomes a matter of waiting it out until the credits start to roll . <p> Fixing this problem would have been as easy as it would have been to fix in the Keanu Reeves masterpiece Speedanother film that suffered from a broken Story Limit . Save Emmet Ottertons rescue until after Bellwhethers arrest . In this way , the filmmakers would have been able to maintain the trust between Author and Audience by crafting a bulletproof narrative . <p> Plot Dynamics : Action , Optionlock , Success , Good <h> Dialing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Plot Dynamics and defining the Four Throughlines of a story would be enough when it comes to nailing down the storyform of a narrativebut its not . It really is only the beginning . From there you need to dive down into the dramatic structure of the narrative in order to get to the bottom of what is causing trouble for everyone . <p> The Throughlines sit at the Domain level of the Dramatica Table of Story Elements . Below that we have the Concern level which is closest to Plot , the Issue level below that which is closest to Theme , and finally at the very bottom we have the Element level which is where you will find Character . <p> Typically we start by identifying the Concerns and working our way down and this was alluded to , in part , in the post on The Throughlines of Zootopia . But I thought it might be interesting to show how I discovered the final storyform as I actually started at the bottom of the chart and worked my way up . <p> For many the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its approach . The one thing you have to remember is to always look for trouble . Zero in on the problem areas and the narrative will leap out at you . The storyform defines the source of conflict within a story . Find the trouble and you will find the storyform . <h> One Choice <p> Once I aligned the Throughlines in their proper arrangement , I went instantly to Nick . His line " Everyone comes to Zootopia thinking they could be anything they want . But you cant . You can only be what you are " screams out an Influence Character Problem of Determination . As far as Nick is concerned , your lot in life is predetermined and there is nothing you can do about it . This viewpoint challenges Hopps and represents the heart of his influence . <p> Selecting this in Dramatica does something really quite remarkable . Before making the selection we still had 64 possible storyforms remaining . Once we select Determination for the Influence Character Problem the number of remaining storyforms is one . <p> That is incredible . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the narrative and moved from 64 possible storyforms down to the one and only . <p> Choices in Blue were choices I made . Choices in Red were the answers to story points that Dramatica predicts you would find in the rest of Zootopia . By running through these Red options and testing them against your own experience with the film , you can see whether or not this is the actual collection of deep thematic story points resting at the bottom of Zootopias structure . <p> This is where the magic happens . <h> Confirming the Prediction <p> Story engines should n't be able to predict what is essentially a creative endeavor , right ? But Dramatica can . Take a look at the rest of Nicks Influence Character Throughline as predicted by Dramatica : <p> The choice of Determination as his Problem , or driving force , puts his Symptomthe thing he sees as the probleminto Trust and his Response to that problem into Test . This is totally Nick . If you asked him what is wrong , he would tell you that you cant trust anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of angle . That 's a Symptom of Trust and a Response of Test . <p> It also forces his Influence Character Concern into Playing a Role , which was suggested in the post on the Four Throughlines of Zootopia . <p> A fun thing to do with Dramatica is to hold off on making choices that you 're pretty sure about , but do n't  know for sure . Playing a Role sounded great for Nick , but I would rather have Dramatica confirm that rather than force it into being . Selecting Determination the way I did as his Problem flipped the switch on Playing a Role , confirming my own writers intuition . <p> That 's a beautiful thing . <p> Moving over to the Overall Story Throughline we see a Concern of Impulsive Responses and a Problem of Hunch . The central problem for everyone in the story and the thing they all have to overcome is that basic animal instinct for survival . The film is a commentary on our own prejudices and that hunch , or intution that someone different than us is out to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative . <p> Incredible . <p> You can also see how a Catalyst of Worry and an Inhibitor of Security totally matches what we see in the film . Anytime an action is taken because someone is worried about what will happen , conflict increases . Anytime they try to protect themselves and increase the relative safety of everyone around them ( Judy resigning ) the conflict in the story slows to a crawl . <p> And then look at Hopps Main Character Throughline . Again , her Problem is that animal instinctor Hunchthat something is amiss . That justification to always be wary , built up by her parents and reinforced by her encounters with a fox when she was younger , fuels that personal problem of hers . Anytime you see her nose twitchyoure seeing that justification of Hunch at work . <p> Hopps does n't  recognize her own problem because she is too focused in on the fact that she has n't  proven herself yet . And she answers this Main Character Symptom of Proven with amazing feats that no bunny has ever performed before ( Main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wisdom again plays into that perspective her parents conditioned her with about being wise around those who would do you harm . Which brings us to the Relationship Story Throughline . <p> As mentioned in the Throughlines of Zootopia post , the relationship between Hopps and Nick is in conflict because of their physicality : a fox and a rabbit . Mortal enemies forced into working with one another . We can easily see their Relationship Story Symptom and Relationship Story Response of Trust and Test in the guise of their distrust of one another and their constant challenging of the others true nature . But take a look at what Dramatica predicts their greatest Issue to be : Security . You would think Threat would be a greater Issue for them , and it does come up in the form of the Relationship Story Counterpoint , but the real source of problems between them rests in this need to feel safe . <p> And that represents the true heart of the message behind Zootopia . In our need to feel safe around one another , we impulsively engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick is Hopps . He just has developed a different way of approaching those big picture problems . <p> The biggest gut punch in Zootopia , the one that stings the most , is the reveal that Hopps still carries around Fox Spray , even when she claims Nick a friend . Its that Hunch creeping in . And it hurts because it reveals just how insecure their relationship truly is . <p> Overcoming that need to feel safe , and Ending a lifes worth of prejudice not only resolves the Relationship Throughline through the Relationship Story Throughline Solution , but also provides a solution for resolving our own interpersonal relationships . <h> A Code to Telling Great Stories <p> There is a code to telling a story , a narrative form that communicates the intention and heart of an author . Zootopia connects with so many because of how accurately it follows the storyform setup by its Throughlines , Character , and Plot Dynamics . While it suffers from a broken Story Limit , this rather minor oversight only diminishes the entertainment value of the storythe message still comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect with audiences generations from now as it is not based on the current cultural climate , but rather familiar thematic issues that we all experience in our own lives . Great stories teach us a different way and offer a solution to resolving our greatest differences . <p> Animation is often thought of as a medium solely for children . In this case , that might not be such a bad thing . Imagine an entire generation influenced by the relationship between Nick and Hopps to overcome their own personal prejudice and misguided intuition . <p> That brave new world will have a great and functioning story to thank for their prosperity . <p> Director Rich Moore was my first " boss " right out of CalArts . He directed me on the television show The Critic where I did most of the character layout for the Billy Crystal character Gary Grossman . Rich was great to work with and I can still hear his unique laugh echoing through my head . So I had even more of a reason to want to love the story dynamics . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas ?

They know that taste relies on choosing how much of each to put in and when they choose to add them into the dish . In a way , an Author is like a chef and should know the ingredients they have to choose from " not rely on how they think their story will taste . <p> In the past few weeks , we focused our attention on the Audience Appreciations of story " those Story Points that help up predict and understand what kind of an Audience will embrace our story and how the experience of that story will feel to them . Turning our attention to the essential base ingredients of story , we shift our focus towards a better understanding of how to craft that experience . <p> Dramatica is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single human mind trying to solve a problem . Character , plot , theme , and genre ? These concepts are not about three-dimensional people or complicating events of rising tension . Rather , they function as analogies to what goes on in that gray mass behind your eyes . <p> And it all started around a campfire . <h> The Storymind Concept <p> Way back when , Ugga and Orga would return from their days adventure and recount what they saw to their fellow cavemates . They told what them what to expect and what to avoid out in the wild . Danger . Excitement . Food . Everything . Eventually , Ugga and Orga wanted to extend their reach beyond their own campfire so they could help out the cavepeople on the other cliff and down in the valley . <p> In essence , they were the first bloggers . <p> But they did n't  have access to Twitter or Facebook , and lacked the means to back up their stories or answer any questions posed to them . The only way to effectively communicate what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases , answered all the questions , and accounted for the various counter-arguments other cavepeople might have in regards to their narrative . What if the sabre-tooth tiger did n't  come after me ? What if I climbed that tree and did n't  find a berry ? Ugga and Orga needed a way to counteract these trolls . They needed to develop a mind for the others to inhabit . <p> Over centuries this matured into the storymind " a self-contained model of the human mind at work . Along the way , some tried to define this model to make it easier for others to communicate . Aristotle . Joseph Campbell . Syd Field . Christoper Vogler . Blake Snyder . With each generation understanding grew , yet somehow was still incomplete . <p> Unfortunately , the hundreds and thousands of years between Ugga and Snyder hid the fact that stories were really just a way to communicate the most appropriate way to solve a problem . Without that reality in mind , any attempt to define story naturally got lost in subjective interpretations of who the characters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . In an attempt to define the who , what , and how , they forgot the why.The true nature of story , it seemed , would remain buried beneath the oceans of time for all eternity . <p> Until Dramatica . <h> The Storymind at Rest <p> In 1993 , Chris Huntley and Melanie Anne Phillips released the Dramatica theory of story . Instead of looking to stories for patterns and trends of character development and spiritual growth , Chris and Melanie sought to identify the ingredients of story from the other side " from the Authors point-of-view . Those other story paradigms ? They explain the experience of hearing or participating in a story . <p> Authors do n't  experience the story they write , they craft and create the story they write . <p> Ugga and Orga werent interested in the experience " they were more concerned with this process of communicating their message as clearly and as completely as possible . Those first storytellers realized you cant serve a delicious meal by simply taste-testing your favorite dishes . <p> You need to know the ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dramatica Table of Story elements at rest : <p> Impressive and imposing , yet perfectly at peace . Self-Interest sits across from Morality . Pursuit from Avoid . The Past from the Present . And even Inequity from Equity . Every single last diagonal relationship within this model tells of a perfect balance . <p> No inequity . No story . <p> In order to make this model messy and create the potential for a story , someone needs to get in there and twist and turn it until the theoretical rubber bands tying these elements together begin to strain under the pressure . Until they verge on the brink of snapping . Someone needs to get in there and start making choices to wind this model up to the point where one tap will send it unravelling , spinning over and over again until it returns to that state of peace . <p> Someone like you . <h> The Eight Dynamic Questions <p> If you want to get your hands dirty writing a story , you 're going to have to answer a few questions . Eight , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure applied at various locations within the model . If you want a different kind of story , you twist it up a different kind of way . <p> Dramatica labels these eight questions dynamic because they claim responsibilty for twisting and turning the model at rest into a fully-realized packed-full-of-potential storymind . Other questions and story points concern themselves with structural aspects of a narrative . These fellas focus on the movement between the various structures . <p> When developing a story , Authors must know the answers to these questions . If they do n't  , their story will likely sputter out and crash three feet in front of them like the rubber-band airplane they did n't  take the time to wind up properly . <p> Take the time to wind up your airplane . <h> Character Arc <p> The first two dynamic questions work together when it comes to defining the forces inherent within a narrative . The Main Character Resolve and the Main Character Growth pair up to define what most see as the " character arc " of the central character of a narrative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the journey it defines " but rather , because of where it sets the Main Character Throughline in relation to the Overall Story Throughline . <p> Every problem is really seen as an inequity between the way we see the world and the world as it truly is . The Main Character Throughline versus the Overall Story Throughline . Understanding where the two converge and which one lies closer to the truth helps us determine how to jumble up that model of the storymind . <p> The Main Character Resolve simply asks : <p> At the end of the story , does the Main Character Remain Steadfast in their worldview or did they Change and adopt the Influence Characters point-of-view ? <p> For those who do n't  know , the Influence Character represents the alternative approach towards solving problems in a story . Typically a mentor , but sometimes a father , or a brother , or a lover , the Influence Character exists to challenge the Main Character by showing him or her the path not taken . They offer an alternative perspective on what the MC could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Main Character Growth , defines the direction of the Main Characters development : <p> Does the Main Character grow by losing a trait or by gaining a trait ? Do they Stop doing something or Start doing something ? <p> The exact application of this second Story Point adjusts depending on the answer to the first question . In a Main Character with a Changed Resolve , the Growth works as expected by adding or dropping a trait . In a Steadfast Main Character , the Growth is seen in the Main Characters relation to the outside world : Are they holding out for something to stop or holding out for something to start ? <p> By putting the answers to these two questions together , an Author winds up the model of the storymind resulting in four very different kinds of stories . <h> Changed/Stop <p> In these stories , the Main Character changes the way they see the world by adopting the Influence Characters point-of-view . They may kick and scream the entire way but by the end , they change their resolve by dropping some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Matrix and starts thinking more like Morpehus and Trinity , Joe ( Tony Curtis ) stops living the life of a distrustful irresponsible ladies man in Some Like it Hot , and Sully stops scaring the crap out of little kids in Monsters , Inc . <h> Changed/Start <p> In these narratives , Authors tell stories of Main Characters who change the way they see things by adding something to their lives . They still adopt the Influence Characters perspective , but they do so by Starting something : <p> Red starts standing up for himself in The Shawkshank Redemption , Matt King ( George Clooney ) in The Descendants starts defending his family , and Oscar ( K+re Hedebrant ) engages in a little of the unspeakable in Let the Right One In . <h> Steadfast/Stop <p> In sharp contrast to the Changed Resolve stories , these Main Characters stand up for themselves and end up changing the way the Influence Character sees the world . This is an important concept to understand : If the Main Character Remains Steadfast , then the Influence Character HAS to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they both change , then the Author has communicated nothing . <p> Ugga and Orga were trying to communicate the most appropriate way to solve problems in their community . In order to combat all those trolls in the cave down by the river , they had to match up one way of solving problems against another . By showing the result of one approach winning out over the other , they were able to effectively argue and convince those idiots how best to lead their lives . <p> The process has n't  changed . <p> Authors can communicate the best way to solve problems by showing the wrong way first , or by showing the right way first . Either way it does n't  matter , as long as one side effectively " wins " over the other . As long as one changes to the others point-of-view . <p> The Main Characters of these stories Remained Steadfast , holding out for something " or someone " to Stop and change to their point-of-view : <p> Hiccup holds out for his father and the other Vikings to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad eventually gets the point . Captain Kirk holds out for Spock and the rest of his teammates to stop running hogwild throughout the galaxy in Star Trek and the Vulcan eventually stops flying off the handle all the time . Marty McFly holds out for his dad and everyone else to stop running away from trouble in Back to the Future and eventually George balls up his fist and takes that swing . <p> Even with those short explanations , one can see the difference in dynamic tension set by these two essential ingredients of story when compared to Changed stories . That difference lies in the method by which the storymind winds up , and by the potentials the windup ultimately creates . <h> Steadfast/Start <p> Finally we look to the Main Characters who hold out in the desparate hope that something will Start : <p> Remy holds out for everyone to start seeing him as a real chef in Ratatouille , Ray Kinsella buys into the whole " If you build it , he will come " idea and dutifully holds out for that moment to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fonda ) holds out for the other jurors to start coming to the realization that this kid is innocent in 12 Angry Men . <p> Again , very different dynamics at work in these kinds of stories . The Main Character in these stories represents the right way to solve problems . By Remaining Steadfast and digging their heels in , they eventually manage to convince the other side to change and adopt their point-of-view . <h> Taking It Back <p> Already one can see the variety of dishes available with only these two ingredients . Essential as they are to the eventual taste and experience of the meal , the Main Character Resolve and Main Character Growth paint an incomplete picture . In order to completely wrap up the storymind into something full of dramatic potential , six more questions must be answered . <p> In the coming weeks , we will discuss these essential questions " essential questions that Ugga and Orga knew instinctively centuries ago .

And while catchy songs , charming vocal performances and a lush color palette contribute to the films success , it is the story at the heart of it all that keeps them coming back for more . <p> This is n't to say that there are n't  story " issues . " Competing personal points-of-view ( i.e. , who is the Main Character ? ) and a weak Overall Story Throughline that starts and stops as it sputters along ( if its so cold , why do n't  you guys just go inside ? ) illustrate but a few of the problematic areas . But yet , the film succeeds in spite of these missteps because of the solid emotional core at the center . The relationship between Anna and Elsa conjures up circumstances unheard of in modern film , let alone an animated one . Like its massive Winter-blockbuster sister Titanic , Frozen will continue to live on because of the emotional argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this argument works becomes essential for those wishing to repeat Frozens monstrous success . The Dramatica theory of story refers to the structure of an argument as a storyform . As a model of the minds problem-solving process , Dramatica sees a complete story as an analogy to what goes on in our own minds . Combining seventy-five story points , this assemblage of thematic material provides the " message " or meaning of the narrative . The closer a story mimics these processes the less chance for story " holes " and the more it will feel complete . The fact that Frozen hits many of these points within the same storyform explains why Audiences have taken it to heart : the film reflects the kind of arguments people make to themselves everyday . <p> Frozen opens up by setting the stage for the problems between the two sisters . Forced to keep her powers in check , Elsa sequesters herself , leaving Anna with wild guesses about why they can no longer build snowmen together ( Relationship Story Problem : Induction ) . The constant rejection puts an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Non-Acceptance ) creating an air of stubborness between them ( Relationship Story Throughline : Fixed Attitude ) . To combat this , Anna responds the only way she knows how : by giving Elsa the kind of love and consent her sister deserves ( Relationship Story Response : Acceptance ) . <p> Unfortunately this response is n't enough , and Elsa acts out ( Relationship Story Benchmark : Impulsive Responses ) . As her powers are revealed , the responses of those in the castle remind Elsa of how her parents reacted that first day and she flees ( Influence Character Problem : Reaction ) . <p> Why label Elsa the Influence Character and not a secondary Main Character , or co-Protagonist ? <p> While Anna and Elsa both provide personal points-of-view , once Elsa sings her song " Let it Go " that initimate view into her struggle fades . This inside look is key when it comes to the Main character Throughline . The view from Anna grows from that moment , placing her in the position of Main Character , an intent of Author verfied in a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story but its really about Elsawe go through her eyes , so she 's technically the protagonist <p> Anna works as both Main Character and Protagonist within the Overall Story ( Dramatica differentiates between the two ) . Elsa assumes the Influence Character role and , after lashing out with her snow monster , takes on the role of Antagonist . In fact , her impact on Anna wanes at this moment , allowing Kristoff to saddle in and take the Influence Character hand-off from Elsa . <p> Both sister and boyfriend-to-be usher forth similar thematic substance in song ( Influence Character Issue : Deficiency vs . Permission ) . Kristoff with his " fixer-upper " song ( Deficiency ) and Elsa with her " Let It Go " performance ( Permission ) provide the necessary challenge to Annas own personal issues . Annas failure to see the forest for the trees when it comes to the limitations imposed on the people around herlike Hans and Elsa ( Main Character Issue : Preconditions ) constrains her efforts to learn why her sister wants nothing to do with her ( Main Character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutinize those she loves ( Main Character Problem : Re-evaluation ) acts both as her downfall and her strength . <p> Ultimately , the story requires an act of " true love " to lift the curse of the frozen wasteland ( Overall Story Throughline : Situation and Overall Story Solution : Proaction ) . Anna answers that call by sticking with her Crucial Element of Non-Acceptance* , choosing her sister over the easy and obvious one before her , Kristoff ( Main Character Resolve : Steadfast ) . The snow lifts and the kingdom of Arendelle returns to what it once was ( Story Outcome : Success ) . Realizing that love , not fear , reconciled the two sisters ( Relationship Story Solution : Deduction ) , Elsa can now use her powers for good , boldly providing joy to her subjects ( Influence Character Resolve : Change and Influence Character Solution : Proaction ) . <p> Moved by her sisters transformation and Kristoffs own bold act of courage ( another instance of Influence Character Solution : Proaction ) , Anna joins in the celebration by doing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a celebration ( Story Judgment : Good ) . <p> As far as improving the central plot , the storyform provides a clue about what could work with the rest of the narrative . For instance the Overall Story Issue of Attraction , could use some attention . The people of Arendelle , drawn by the brilliance and radiance of Elsas castle , could have attempted to make the trek up the mountain , only to succumb to the cold or the treacherous cliffs . Or these same people could have been drawn more and more to the charisma of Hans to the point of turning against their compatriots . Either of these could have illustrated the Overall Story Issue of Attraction and added to the richness of the story by showing how being drawn to something increases conflict . <p> The Consequence of Contemplations , also missing from the final film , offers a chance to raise the stakes far beyond " freezing to death " . The consequence of failing to lift the frost should n't be death , it should be something closer to the thought that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While that may sound inconsequential when compared to the loss of life , it plays stronger thematically against Elsas issues of letting go and being herself . It also works with Anna and Elsas Relationship Concern of Contemplations . By playing out the conflict of what it feels like to have your own sister think less of you against the consequence of everyone feeling the same way , the film could have added a nice thematic subtext to Annas journey . <p> Regardless of how these story points could have been exposed , bringing them to the film would have helped shore up the logical side of the story and help stifle those criticisms that felt the plot lacked sophistication . <p> These Issues of Attraction and Consequences of Contemplations are n't  random ; they work in harmony with the thematics already there in the final product . What better place to explore the problems of attraction and what people think of you than in a story where the two principal characters struggle with what they 're allowed to do and what others are imposing on them . The storyform works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it offers an opportunity to see the entirety of an argument from every angle , important if you want a story to feel complete . <p> This is n't to say there are n't  some wonderful touch points from the storyform found in the actual film . The Influence Character Unique Ability , which grants the Influence Character the ability to thwart the Main Character , is set to Permissionits up to Elsa who Anna can and can not marry . And what of the Relationship Story Catalyst ? This story point increases the conflict between the Main Character and Influence Character . The storyform calls for Investigation which works perfectly for what is already there in Frozen . Every time Anna tries to delve into why her sister wont talk to her ( the " Do You Wan na Build a Snowman " song or her first time to the Ice Castle ) the tension between the two sisters mounts . <p> And lastly , take a look at Annas Main Character Critical Flaw . This bit of structure weakens the Main Characters ability to resolve the issues at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . Factoring in all the other thematic choices madeeverything from the Story Outcome of Success to the Relationship Story Symptom of Non-acceptance to the Influence Character Solution of Proactionthe story requires Annas Critical Flaw to be Attraction . In other words , Annas attraction to others diminishes her ability to save the day . <p> Sound familiar ? <p> Her relationship with Hans and the reveal that comes later works because it is exactly the kind of thing needed to solidify the storys structure . Main Characters are as blind to their Critical Flaws as much as we are to our own . Assuming her place within the story ( as Audiences do with Main Characters ) , we become just as blind to that attraction . Instead of some silly surprise that comes out of nowhere , our realization of what Hans represents becomes something much more meaningful to the actual structure of the story . <p> Frozen will endure in the hearts and minds of so many people because of the solid storyform at the center of it all . As voice actor Josh Gad recently said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to create these films that continue to speak to generation after generation because of the timeless themes they address , and I think Frozen might belong in that pantheon of great films . <p> " Timeless themes " communicate loud and clear when presented within the framework of a solid argument .

Frozen took this approach and secured for itself a place within the grand tradition of beloved Disney animated features .

@@119272664 @8272664/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Flipping Perspectives <p> Parsing meaning from story requires an eagle-eye for detail and a refusal to participate in generalities . Along with this greater focus on accuracy , however , comes the responsibility of making allowances for deeply held beliefs over how and why a story operates . <p> No greater does this responsibility make itself known than in the argument over whether or not certain characters change within a story . Dramatica , the first iteration of Narrative Science , seems to only call for one major character to change . How can that be when one considers stories like Toy Story , The Sixth Sense and Pride and Prejudice where it seems both principal characters change ? <p> Counter-intuitive as this must seem in light of these examples , an effective story demands it . <h> A Rule That Supports Meaning <p> As covered in the previous article A Reason for Rules , an effective story proves the Authors argument by featuring two principal characters with conflicting perspectives on how best to solve the storys central problem . One gives way to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that " wins " ends up bringing everyone to triumph , then the Author has successfully argued for the efficacy of that winning perspective . If instead the winning approach leads to tragedy , then the Author has argued that that perspective was most inappropriate . <p> Authors use the perspectives of the two central characters to prove their take on the world . <h> A Change of Resolve , Not a Change of Growth <p> Dramaticas first story point deals specifically with the perspective of one of these principal charactersthe Main Character . Referring to this bit of story structure as the Main Characters Resolve , it simply asks whether the Main Character Changes or Remains Steadfast in their resolve . In other words , has the Main Character stayed consistent within their worldview ( Steadfast ) or have they " flipped " , and completely adopted a whole new way of seeing things ( Change ) ? <p> As an asideand another " rule " of story structurewhatever the Main Characters final Resolve happens to be , the other principal character in the story , the Influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this in just a bit . <p> Luke Skywalker in Star Wars , Rick in Casablanca and Ralph from Wreck-It Ralph all clearly adopt a brand new way of seeing things . They shed the old for the new . <p> But Dr. Richard Kimball ( Harrison Ford ) from The Fugitive , Ray Kinsella ( Kevin Costner ) from Field of Dreams , and Anna Khitrova ( Naomi Watts ) from Eastern Promises clearly do n't  behave in this manner . Instead of growing by transferring their point-of-view to another track , they stand their ground and grow by remaining true to what they hold most dear . <p> These Main Characters grow , but they do n't  change their mindset . Change as Dramatica sees it speaks of adopting a brand new point-of-viewone that requires eschewing all remnants of the past . Still , even with this explanation firmly in mind many struggle with the idea that of some Main Characters not changing . <h> A Problem of Semantics <p> Unfortunately Dramatica runs into this issue quite often . Greater accuracy and insight into how story structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken for granted . The concept of Protagonist works in a general sense , but when delineating the objective perspective of the Overall Story from the personal first-person perspective of the Main Character , the common general approach muddles the Authors argument ( For more on this , please see Redefining Protagonist and Main Character ) . When answering Dramaticas structural questions or trying to determine a certain aspect of your storys structure , you have to know what it is you are actually looking at . <p> But perhaps this use of the word " Change " and applying it to only one of the principal characters becomes too much . It may be the most accurate way to describe the process of a fully-functioning story , but it might also be creating confusion where there should n't be . Like many of the terms found in earlier versions of Dramatica such as Preconscious and Obstacle Character ( now Impulsive Responses and Influence Character respectively ) , a slight modification might be in order . <h> Suggestions for Clarification <p> Instead of asking whether or not a character has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their initial perspective has stayed consistent throughout the end of the story or has it been transferred or rejected , or even betterhas it " flipped " ? Instead of Main Character Resolve : Change or Steadfast , perhaps Main Character Perspective : Consistent or Flipped . In this way we drop the rather-charged word of " change " from the equation and make it easier for Authors and analysts to define where and when a story needs fixing . <p> More importantly though , we should drop the idea that the converse is true ( if the Main Character stays consistent the Influence Character will flip ) . Why ? Because stories define Influence Characters by their impact on the Main Character , not by how their perspectives have changed personally for themselves . Structurally speaking we do n't  jump into their shoes the same way we do with the Main Character . From the vantage point of the Main Character its not important whether or not the Influence Characters Perspective stays consistent or is rejected , but rather whether or not their influence over the Main Character has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With this in mind the problems concerning the dynamics between the Main and Influence Characters in Toy Story , The Sixth Sense and Pride and Prejudice quickly fade away . <p> In Toy Story it seems as if Woody changes . How else would one interpret his ability to share the top spot on the bed with another toy ? Yet , if one dives deep into the structure of this great film clarity shines through . Woody does n't  change his point-of-view , he matures into it . " It does n't  matter how much were played withwhat matters is that were here for Andy when he needs us " describes his initial perspective . That belief grows throughout the film until it becomes so strong he is willing to sacrifice everything to be there for Andy . <p> If Woody had shed his identity as Andys toy and somehow became as delusional as Buzz then yes , he would have been considered a Change character . Change characters disown their original point-of-view . <p> Malcom from The Sixth Sense and Elizabeth from Pride and Prejudice operate this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for how they really are and Elizabeth agrees to marry the man she promised she never would . Looking at their respective Influence Characters Cole and Mr. Darcy , we begin to see the importance of indentifying their influence over their respective Main Characters and where that ultimately ends up . <p> In The Sixth Sense Cole may see things personally in a different light , he may have seemingly " changed " but when it comes to his actual influence over Malcom , its still there in the end . He may understand what it is the ghosts want from him and he may be finally facing his fears , but that influence he has over Malcomthat stubborn denial of peer pressure and verbal attacks against his characterthats still there as well . He puts up with everyone thinking him a " freak " because he sees things others do n't  , an attitude that ultimately influences Malcom to open up his own eyes . <p> In regards to Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice , the man in question may have endeavored to prove how much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and general demeanor which held influence over her did not become wholly irrelevant . Why else would her father still question her final decision if he did not still sense that sense of pride within Mr. Darcy ? His quality of character may have subdued a little by taking a different direction , but it was not rejected outright . <p> Contrast these instances of consistent influence with those of Sam Gerard ( Tommy Lee Jones ) , Terrence Mann ( James Earl Jones ) , and Nikolai Luzhin ( Viggo Mortensen ) from The Fugitive , Field of Dreams , and Eastern Promises . These characters grow in such a way that their influence ultimately becomes inconsequential to their respective Main Characters . Gerards " I do n't  care " turns into " I care enough to keep the Police from killing you . " Manns refusal to open the door to his own apartment turns into a willingness to step into the unknown . Nikolais rise to power insures the safety of the baby and ultimately Anna herself . <p> All of these reflect instances where the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing things essentially vanished . By becoming inconsequential , these characters solidified the stalwart resolve of the counterparts . <h> Change Clouds the Meaning within a Storys Structure <p> To search for change within a storys structure only befuddles the observer . Change is everywhere . The change from one Acts Signpost to another , the change within the Story Limit as time runs out or options disappear , and yes , the change within the Main Character as they grow to a point where their resolve comes into question . <p> Talented writers know change must happen , they know their characters must grow else the story lie dormant and dead . To tell these same writers that only one principal character actually changes while the other remains steadfast runs counter to their instincts and fuels the fire for the inaccuracy of Dramatica and Narrative Science as a whole . Better to quantify and clarify what the storyform actually seeks out rather than stay true to original terminology .. <p> By seeking instead for the consistency or " flipping " of the Main Characters perspective , writers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing or not changing . In addition , by understanding the true role of the Influence Character within the structure of a story and how it is their influence that should be judged , not their personal resolve , and understanding of how these two perspectives work together to define the meaning of a story , writers and analyst can confidently get back to the work of creating fully functional and purposeful stories .

Nailing down exactly what those problems are and how best to dramatize them can be difficult , especially given the basic understandings of story prevalent today . <p> One popular sub-genre of dysfunction is that of the dysfunctional family . <p> Dysfunctional families experience trouble because of psychological problems , problems that cant resolve by defeating a bad guy or winning a race . Their problems stem from the way the individual family members think , rather than what they say or do . A successful resolution to their problems will find the family functional once againan outcome that will hinge upon the Goal of the story . <h> Determining the Story Goals of Dysfunction <p> Typically , when presented with a story like this the Goal has something to do with bringing the family back together . Whether that relies on maintaining the American dream as it is in American Beauty , or simply being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Incredibles , the Goal of the story becomes less about what the Protagonist wants and more about overcoming the inequity at the source of the dysfunction . <p> How exactly does one figure out the Goal of a story ? <p> Story Goals are always about overcoming the inequity created by the Inciting Incident . The Goals of most Hollywood films are relatively easy to figure out because they base themselves on problems that need some kind of physical achievement by the characters in order to resolve them . <p> In Unforgiven there are some bad men that need killin . In The Matrix humans need to gain the upper hand over their computer overlords . And in Casablanca there are two tickets of transit that spell freedom for a couple of lucky souls . External problems that need external solutions . <p> But what physical prize needs exists in American Beauty , or Eat , Drink , Man , Woman or Little Miss Sunshine ? For that matter , what about The Incredibles or Down n Out in Beverly Hills or even the classic Frank Capra comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dysfunctional families , yet have no clearly delineated external Goal for the characters to reach . <p> With Brad Birds incredible The Incredibles one could argue that the Goal is to defeat Syndrome . Referring back to the article Sophisticated Story Goals , pureeing the bad guy was n't enoughViolet had to take that final step and become a part of the family . With her force-field firmly set , the dysfunctional Parrs became the functional Parrs , paving the way for them to finally enjoy Saturday juvenile sports just like all the other " normal " families . <p> Story Goals are not always about achieving things , yet they are always about resolving inequities . As Chris Huntley , co-creator of the Dramatica theory of story recently pointed out ( source ) : <p> By definition , a Story Goal is a form of accomplishment . Do not confuse the nature of the story point with the methodology to reach it . Otherwise , EVERY goal would be an obtaining goal , and that does not accurately reflect the way many stories are intended . Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the end as the point , and not the means . <p> While a Goal may appear to be some sort of achievement , that accomplishment is not as important to the meaning of a story as the means to achieve it . In order to figure out how a dysfunctional family might mend itself , it becomes necessary for one to address the exact inequity of a particular story . <h> Inequities of Dysfunction <p> In American Beauty , patriarch Lester Burnham ( Kevin Spacey ) must put into words how his contribution to the workplace fits in . An inequity grows from that one Inciting Incident , an inequity of dysfunction that had been bubbling for years , an inequity that threatens the stability of the Burnhams perfect American fairytale family . The Goal is n't about Lester sleeping with the 16-year old cheerleader ( no matter how much he wish it were ) , it is something more psychological in nature . The only way to truly resolve the issues plaguing the Burnhams is for each character to put aside their own personal agendas and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family life should be . <p> The same kind of inequity exists in the Richard Dreyfuss/Bette Midler comedy Down n Out in Beverly Hills , albeit a bit less melodramatic . Set squarely in the late 80s , the dysfunctional Whitemans family encounters a bum ( Nick Nolte ) with an eye for the truth . Again , as with American Beauty , there is no bad guy to defeat , no treasure to find , and no mountain to climb , yet there is still this feeling that something is wrong . That feeling finds its source with the role each character feels they have to play . The maid as mistress , the dutiful mother who would rather be anything else , the son who floats from filmmaker to glam-rocker to express himself each of these are acts of pretense that must move aside in order for the Whitemans to overcome their dysfunction . <p> In the slapstick classic Arsenic and Old Lace , drama critic Mortimer Brewster ( Cary Grant ) discovers that his two sweet aunts are homicidal maniacs . Learning that his familys dysfunction extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt ) , Mortimer begins scheming and manipulating those around him based on the concern that he might , in fact , become mad like the rest of them . Avoiding this insane transformation is the only way the inequity of the story can resolve , especially when a second dead body turns out not to be the work of his aunts , but rather his older brother , Jonathan ! <p> Three different stories ( four if you count The Incredibles ) , three different genres , yet they all focus the dramatic eye on the same kind of inequity problematic ways of thinking . <h> So How Does It All Turn Out ? <p> In The Incredibles everything worked out for the Parrs . Down n Out In Beverly Hills ? The Whitemans awake from their wild party sans makeup , both real and psychological . The dysfunctional family now fully functional . <p> Arsenic and Old Lace ? They cart the aunts , along with both brothers , to the insane asylum . But more importantly Mortimer learns of his adoption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating offspring as wild and crazy as these nutbags disappears as quickly as it had come . That fear of becoming just like them has dissipated , and with it the inequity of the story . <p> American Beauty , unfortunately , does not have such a rosy ending . <p> Whether you look at Lesters tragic demise , or his wife Carolyn who discovers far too late how great he is , or the Colonel who ca n't find a way to make who he is into the concept of what he thinks he should be , the inequity of the story persists . The story is a failure , and if it werent for Lesters cheerful take on the whole thing it would have come off as a tragedy the likes of Se7en or Hamlet . <h> The Trouble with Dysfunction <p> The psychology story is an opportunity for an Author to explore issues of a different feather , issues left untouched by the majority of Hollywood films . <p> Why is that ? <p> Those in the West rarely examine the way they reach conclusions . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when it comes to matters of psychology they most often are not sure what it is they are dealing with . Confused as to the nature of the story within their hands , they label it a personal drama story or feel the work in question if far too eclectic for common tastes . <p> In reality , the resistance shows itself in those who are uncomfortable with the thought that the way they go about coming up with ideas may in fact be fraught with issues and inequity . <p> The dramatists purpose , then , is to reveal it to them . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Stories of dysfunctional families often find their Objective Story Throughlines in Psychology . In contrast to stories found within the Mind domain , OS Psychology stories explore the problems that arise from the way people think , rather than what they think . <p> Diving down further one finds the four Concerns of Psychology : Conceptualizing , Conceiving , Being and Becoming . Recent versions of the software offer users simpler terms to replace them . Conceptualizing becomes Developing a Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Role and Becoming becomes Transforming Ones Nature . While these new " layman " terms might be easier for the newbie to grok , they tend to narrow down and obfuscate what is really happening at this level . As with all things Dramatica , understanding what the terms truly mean becomes more important than the terms themselves . <p> Down n Out and The Incredibles find their OS Concerns in Being . Arsenic and Old Lace in Becoming . American Beauty finds the source of its troubles in Conceptualizing . <p> One of the more compelling ideas to come out of Dramatica is the notion that a particular Storys Goal will be similar in nature to the OS Concern . <p> In The Incredibles this means the Parr family has to Be themselves in order to overcome the inequity of the story . In Down n Out they simply have to stop Be-ing . In Arsenic and Old Lace Mortimer needs to stop trying to Become like his adoptive family . And in American Beauty Lester and Co. need to Conceptualize a new model of the American family .

They sit down , start their timers or zero out their word counts , and begin connecting to their Muse . But what if there was a way to define your hearts desire and tie that voice directly to the structure of your story ? <p> Presumably a writer becomes a writer because they have something they want to say , some unique perspective on the world that they want to communicate to others . Why write if you have nothing to say ? Many who take to writing do not feel comfortable expressing themselves and see the act as a means to extract this creative impetus . That inner drive " that inner voice " is what compels a writer to sit behind a keyboard and take pen to paper . <h> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ask yourself What is it that I hold most dear ? What do you believe in , and what do you see as being the truth ? It will be different for every man , woman , and child but there will be something " some truism that eminates from your heart . <p> In our Narrative First Weekend Workshops , I used to help writers find these truisms by filling in the blank for this statement : <p> People need <p> Some answer food , some water , others love , and others creative expression . And you do n't  even need to use to word " need " , you can use can , want , should " anything that justifies a certain position on what is truth and what is not . People should go to church . People want acceptance . People cant reach for the stars . <h> Finding Meaning within Context <p> Nothing means nothing without context . A grape can be round or a grape can be green , its meaningor truthlies in the context taken by the viewer . Insoluble arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will get to the insoluble arguments soon enough , but for now let 's focus on giving context to our hearts truth . Context is that which surrounds and gives meaning , so let 's give meaning to our truisms : <p> People need food in order to survive . <p> People need creative expression in order to feel fulfilled . <p> Adding the phrase " in order to " forces us to grant a context for what we believe . It gives meaning to our truth . <p> The Western Occult story we kicked Nanowrimo off with in earlier this November in the article Creating a Story from Scratch with Nanowrimo lacked a certain truth . Overall it felt cool and entirely unique , but the Artists point-of-view was nowhere to be found . We were focused on exploring the Dramatica storyform " and the Dramatica storyform says nothing about what lies within the heart of the writer-artist . It helps the artist communicate that inner truth , but the artist must still identify what it is they want to say . <p> Continuing our month-long series on using Dramatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time out this week to help develop that story by digging deep within ourselves to find a truth worth writing . <h> The Driving Force Behind a Narrative <p> The first step to grafting my heart onto the cold and impeccable storyform for our Western Occult story is to identify a truth I hold dear . Since it is Thanksgiving week here in America , I 'll go with something that reflects the holiday spirit : <p> People need to be grateful in order to feel that they are part of a community . <p> Ahhh that 's nice , is n't it ? Very Thanksgiving-y and a very true statement within a given context . The next thing to do would be to define an alternate context in which that statement is n't true . You can do this easily by adding the word UNLESS to the end of the statement and following it with a definition of a different point-of-view . <p> People need to be grateful in order to feel that they are part of a community UNLESS their focus on their socio-economic status makes it impossible to feel thankful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Needing to be grateful in order to feel part of a community is indeed true . However , if your priority is class warfare and the social status of one group of people vs. another then being told to feel grateful can feel condescending . Why should someone be grateful for the scraps they are served ? <p> With the juxtaposition of these two truisms " two statements that contradict each other , yet maintain truth within their own context " we create an inequity to fuel our narrative . Arguing which point-of-view is more appropriate within the context of resolving the Story Goal becomes the duty of the Author . <p> This can be a difficult thing to determine at the beginning . Personally , I believe both truisms and I 'm not sure which one I feel is more appropriate . Working my way back to the Dramatica storyform will help solidify my position and grant me a better understanding of what my story truly means . <h> A Problem to Be Resolved <p> Before the story begins , the world is in stasis . The first Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and upsets that tender balance , throwing the world of the story into upheaval . The characters identify the Problem created by this imbalance and determine an appropriate Solution . A Goal of common concern arises from this Solution . Some are for it , others are against it . The Consequence of failing motivates those for and provides a rally cry for those against . <p> In our story Being Loose is the Problem and Holding Sway over Someone the Solution . In order to gain that control a Goal of Wishing for the Gold to Come Into Existence becomes a point of contention for the people of this town . Some will be all for this constant wishing , seeing it as a means to hold sway over the less educated.2 Others will be against it because of the doomed future predicted by the towns one and only horse . <p> At first I thought it would be a conflict between those who use religion to control the masses and those enlightened by science and education , but comparing that Consequence with the Goal the story seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Personally , I find arguments over dark gray and darker gray to be more interesting than black vs. white and therefore think this relation between Goal and Consequence to be perfect for my own artistic expression . <h> Assigning Points-of-Views to Structure <p> Having identified the Problem and Solution and Goal and Consequence , we now turn our attention towards the subjective viewpoints within our story . <p> Every complete narrative juxtaposes one approach towards solving problems against another . One is maintained by the Main Character of the story , the other by the Influence Character . The two battle it out over the course of the story until one adopts the others point-of-view . This adoption leads to either Success or Failure in the efforts to achieve the Story Goal , and that outcome defines the Authors argument . In short , a story offers two perspectives on how to best solve a problem and argues which one is more appropriate by showing the outcome of one " winning " over the other . <p> Remember our truism statements from above : <p> People need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community UNLESS their focus on their socio-economic status makes it impossible to feel grateful . <p> One of these describes our Main Character Abbys point-of-view , the other our Influence Character Jacks point-of-view . Since this is a very different kind of Western , I think I 'll have Abby take the gritty " poor socio-economic status makes it difficult to be thankful " position . Jack will maintain that " a gracious attitude leads to a greater sense of community . " <h> A Purpose to Conflict <p> Suddenly there is purpose to Abbys drive to Arrest the Bounty Hunter . She finds herself motivated to take this action because of her poor socio-economic status . Arresting criminals and collecting the reward for them is her way out of a life of scraping by while others sit in wealth and splendor . Most importantly , the problems and point-of-view she takes is directly connected to something personal and important to me that I want to express as an artist . <p> Same thing with Jack . His unpleasant and repulsive demeanor comes as a result of having to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels like he can say anything to anyone at any time or place simply because they lack the ability to give thanks is a point-of-view I can really get behind . <p> When it comes to Wishing Gold Into Existence , Jack is of the opinion that people are n't  grateful enough for what they do have , and if they were they would have a greater sense of community . To him , it does n't  make sense to get on your knees and pray for something you do n't  even need . Be grateful and keep yourself from praying for an impossibility . <p> Abby sits on the other side of the argument . Why should they be happy with what they have when it feels so bad to have so little ? To Abby , its difficult to be thankful when you are served table scraps . And that 's why you should fight and take whatever you can from whoever you find . <p> Looking back over the storyform , I am reminded that Jack will Change and adopt Abbys point-of-view and that switch will lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that happens in and around the town with the Cattle Baronness , Jack eventually comes to the conclusion that Abby is right : you get what you take . <p> Unfortunately , by adopting this perspective they all Fail to wish gold into existence ( which , of course , was always an impossibility ) and are stuck with having their futures predicted by the town horse . <p> Its sad and its dark , but it fits . If Abby had instead adopted Jacks more " positive " viewpoint then perhaps the wishing would have led to a greater sense of community spirit and a fading desire to believe in superstitions . They would have elevated themselves by holding sway over their own lesser natures . <p> Unfortunately he did n't  , and the lesser of two evils persists . However , this failure is bittersweet as it turns out to be a Good thing for everyone " particularly Abby . Breaking out of ones socio-economic standing is difficult , if not impossible . Standing up and taking what little you can for yourself is sometimes the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth to Heart <p> By identifying truisms near and dear to my own belief systems , my motivation for writing and completing this story skyrockets . Instead of simply defining the argument to be made to the Audience , I now know what I want to argue to the Audience . Yes , being grateful can lead to a greater sense of community but really , if you want to feel good against an impossible situation you sometimes have to take what you can when you can . <p> By connecting what I deeply hold true to a solid and well-crafted argument , my story becomes uniquely mine . My beliefs , my experience , my desire to express myself to the greater community drives my heart to connect with yours . <p> And for that , I will be forever grateful . <p> Apparently the week of Thanksgiving is the time to prepare to defend ones point-of-view by thinking intensely about truth and context .

@@119272684 @8272684/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> The Main Character 's Central Problem <p> Youve heard your Main Character needs some inner conflict , a goal for them to work towards . But you 're never told why that exists or how to develop this very important part of your story . Until now . <p> I 'm a huge fan of screenwriting books . Love em . I 've got two shelves at home stacked with everything from Aristotle to Snyder and each one is well worn . When you have amassed a collection as great as mine you begin to notice patterns within the different texts . One of these is the idea that the central character in a story , the Main Character , must have some kind of internal struggle that exists outside of the struggles that many of the other characters face . <p> Unfortunately that 's usually as far as those texts go in explaining why this is . They rarely offer concrete assistance , and when they do it always seems to be lacking . <h> So What 's the Problem ? <p> The Main Characters central problem is tied thematically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not something separate or something random that you can just force in there . And there is something very precise with how it should be employed in a successful story . Often , though it is not always the case , overcoming this problem will help solve the problems affecting everyone in what is generally considered the A story line . <p> To clarify this understanding , let 's bring in a real world example . Its one thing to pontificate about story theory and quite another to see it in action . With that in mind , when it comes to great examples of the Main Characters central problem we need look no further than everyones favorite curmudgeon : Phil Connors . <p> In the DVD commentary for the film Groundhog Day , writer/director Harold Ramis mentions the idea that Phils growth of character was modeled after Elisabeth Knbler-Ross famous five stages of grief . In order these stages are denial , anger , depression , bargaining and acceptance . Since there are plenty of other places that explore these five stages in more detail , this article will focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Solutions <p> Stories are all about solving problems . Through the Main Character , we the audience get to experience what it feels like to live with these problems , and if the story calls for it , discover a way to overcome them . If the Main Character resolves their issues ( and not every one does ) , then they have found the appropriate solution to their problems . This is precisely what happens in Groundhog Day . <p> Following the five stages , Phils solution is quite obviously Acceptance . <p> PHIL : No matter what happens tomorrow or for the rest of my life , I 'm happy now because I love you . <p> Phil has learned to accept his predicament and live in the moment . By doing so , he resolves the problems surrounding him and thus , gets to enjoy the fruits of his transformation . <p> So what then is Phils Central Problem ? What drives him to do the things he does ? What thing is responsible for all the issues he experiences within the story ? <h> The Course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Phil starts without acceptance in his life . Going from a lack of something to an abundance of that very same thing offers little in terms of scene development , i.e. its boring . A more effective approach is to fill the Main Character with an abundance of a trait that offers the most dramatic tension with the Solution . In Phils case , this trait would be Rejection . <p> If Acceptance is allowing something in , then Rejection would be pushing something away . Put the two terms together in a room and watch the sparks fly . That 's the basis for dramatic tension and an excellent model of what Phils character arc is all about . <p> The following are a few choice examples of Phil rejecting those around him : <p> PHIL : I would love to stand here and talk to you but I 'm not going to . <p> NED : What are you doing for dinner ? <p> PHIL : Something else . <p> and finally <p> RITA : Phil , are you going to the groundhog dinner ? <p> PHIL : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is that he keeps pushing people away , he keeps rejecting them . This problematic attitude continues throughout the first act and into most of the second . It is this trait that causes him the most trouble and is at the center of his personal journey . When he replaces that Rejection in his heart with Acceptance , his problems end , he wins the girl , and tomorrow finally comes . <h> Meaning and Structure <p> The whole purpose behind analyzing a films structure is to determine what the authors original intent was . Most authors write because they have something to say and because they want to communicate some greater meaning . Analysis seeks to identify this meaning . Usually the process of breaking a film down is a guessing game that is open to interpretation , but with Groundhog Day we have an example where the author is in effect , giving us the answer . <p> If Ramis intent was to show Phil growing into acceptance than it follows that Phils solution , the one thing that would resolve his personal issues , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to construct a meaningful story , Phil would need to start out driven by a trait with the most dynamic tension with that solution . In this case , that trait would be Rejectiona resistance or a need to run counter to what is offered to a character . <p> This then is the meaning of Groundhog Day and is the reason why so many people hold the film close to their hearts . Phil grows from a person who rejects others to one who accepts what happens to him . In doing so , he solves the logistical problem of being stuck in the same day over and over again , and personally becomes a better person for it . <p> Groundhog Day is a perfect example of structure communicating the meaning . Phils central problem is clear , identifiable , and matched with a meaningful solution . Your writing should have the same . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> According to the above analysis , Phils Main Character Problem would be Acceptance and his Solution would be Non-Acceptance ( Rejection ) . The Problem and Solution are always Dynamic Pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A lack of Acceptance is not the same thing as Non-Acceptance in the same way that a lack of Faith is not the same as Disbelief . This explains why Phil needed to be the kind of person who pushed others away , or rejected them , in order for the story to work as well as it does . <p> Typically , when analyzing a story with Dramatica one starts with the top of the model and works their way down to a finer granularity . Knowing what I did about Ramis motivation to use the five stages of grief , I actually started at the bottom of the chart and picked his Solution of Acceptance . From there , the rest of the storyform simply fell into place .

Featuring a brand new 35mm print and followed by an extended QnA with not only director Quentin Tarantino and producer Lawrence Bender , but also Mr. Blonde Michael Madsen himself , the event reignited my passion for great storytelling and filmmaking . <p> Reaching for my phone quickly after , I dialed up the official Dramatica analysis of Reservoir Dogs to look over the story dynamics and deep narrative structure . I love challenging myself to figure out exactly where the key points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern when I read that the Overall Story Issue was Self-Interest and the Overall Story Problem Pursuit .

Shoot him and I shoot you . By aiming his pistol at Mr. White , " Nice Guy " Eddie ( Chris Penn ) is saying Thats my dad . You shoot Joe , I shoot you . By continuing to point his gun at the fallen Mr. Orange ( Tim Roth ) , Joe is saying This guy is a cop . He supports the other side . <p> The conflict in this film is all about problems of Support .

" <p> That 's calling out a problem with Attitude , not Self-Interest . <p> Selecting this key story point over Pursuit resets the entire storyform .

White feels obligated to take care of White and get him to a hospital . <p> " You 're not gon na fuckin die , kid .

Contrast this with a story analyst with over twenty years of experience with the theory ( me ) who struggled with the former , would never dare try and make a decision on the latter , and who basically spent most of the film completely awestruck at the level of artistry involved with the animation . To say Inside Out is a great story is an understatement . In a time when a lotof feature filmsstray frommeaningful narrative , it is nice to see that someone still cares . <p> Before getting into the deep analysis presented by my children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limit in the history of storytelling : the five islands of Rileys personality . Typically the Story Limit can be a difficult and often obscured point to define . Here , not so much . As the islands fall into the abyss we the Audience know that the climax is rapidly approaching . We know the scope of the story and we know when it will end . This is the purpose of the Story Limit . From now on these islands will be the penultimate expression of an Optionlock . <h> Deep Analysis <p> The Overall Story Goal is the point of resolution all the characters in the story are focused on . This includes Joy , and Sadness , and Anger and Fear and Disgust and mom and dad and everyone elseincluding Riley . The Overall Story Throughline takes an objective look at everyones conflict . When asked the Story Outcome of Inside Outdid the film end in Success or Failurethe unanimous answer from my children was Success . When asked what the Goal of the story was , i.e. why it was a Success , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , They figured out you ca n't be happy without being sad . <p> I had been contemplating an Overall Story Throughline in Psychology and this answer pretty much sealed the deal for me . Figuring Out You Ca n't Be Happy without Being Sad is a wonderful StoryEncoding for an Overall Story Goal of Conceptualizing . Typically a difficult narrative Type to understand , Conceptualizing can also be thought of as Developing a Plan . Certainly Joyalong with many of the other charactersfeel like they know best how to manipulate Riley . Anger goes so far as to pull a light bulb out and shove it into the control console in an attempt to give Riley the idea of running away . Conceiving an Idea is another narrative Type that works alongside Conceptualizing and sits under the umbrella of Psychology along with Being and Becoming.2 All four of these Types function as Acts within the narrative and it is safe to say that these are an excellent representation of the kind of major conflict going on between all the characters . <p> As we continued to do our own family analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ( Story Judgment of Good ) and that she was the kind of character who preferred to take action first before trying to change herself ( Main Character Approach of Do-er ) . Be-ers are the kind of characters who prefer to change themselves first before taking action , and this really did n't  sound like Joy at all . They also unanimously agreed that Joy Changed her Main Character Resolve ( instead of Remaining Steadfast ) . But when it came to the other half of Joys " character arc " the Main Character Growthmost of them clammed up . <p> The Main Character Growth asks whether the Main Character grew to the point where they could change their resolve because they Stopped something or because they Started something . Most of the time I leave this Story Point to Dramatica ( If you make another decisions on Story Points , Dramatica will actually tell you whether or not your Main Character is a Stop or Start character . Its magic and worth seeing in person. ) , though occasionally I 'll make a guess as to what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the end . <p> My other ten year old son ( the mildly autistic one ) did n't  hestitate to answer . <p> " She needed to start letting other emotions in . " Another proud moment for this father . Stop characters are often told as characters with chips on their shoulders . Start characters are often displayed as characters with holes in their hearts . Now , while Joy is not the kind of heartless sonofabitch you typically find in this position ( like Rick in Casablanca or William Munny in Unforgiven ) , she did have a hole in her understanding of the importance of certain emotions . Starting to see the importance of these moved her to the point where she could finally Change and allow sadness in . <p> Dramatica works because it is a theory of story built on psychology , not on collected data and repeated analysis of film . Storytelling is instinctive and practiced by children from an early age .

@@119272688 @8272688/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Avatar and Star Wars : Spectacle Over Substance <p> James Camerons latest sci-fi action spectacular has taken quite a few hard knocks in the story department , the predominant being that the characters are far too simplistic . But those same people who so easily cry foul would be shocked to learn that this same issue afflicts one of their most cherished films of all time , Star Wars . <p> The generation of filmmakers who grew up in the 70s and early 80s often cite the original Star Wars as the film that inspired them to choose a career in cinema . To many , this sci-fi flick is beyond reproach , a holy relic untouchable by harsh criticism . Unfortunately , having been affected by this film at such a young age , these sci-fi fans have become blind to the now apparent shortcomings the story hasthe same deficiencies they claim Avatar has . <h> Lazy Writing or Archetypal Characters ? <p> Let 's get this out of the way right up front . Yes , Avatar is a rehash of Dances With Wolves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps into the shoes of his enemy , more often than not , a poor hopeless Earth-loving native . Using this , however , to argue that Camerons film is a victim of lazy writing completely misses the reason why a writer would call upon familiar elements of character and plot . The " Its just Dances with Wolves in outer space " argument signifies a superficial understanding of the mechanics of story . <p> Avatar had to be predictable character-wise in order for Cameron to fully explore the visual world he created . The more time spent on character development , the less time there is to set up fantastic worlds and visual spectacle.Up In The Air can delve into Ryan Binghams ( George Clooneys ) personal issues because the world he inhabits is our world . Same with Crazy Heart or The Wrestler . The world of an Avatar , on the other hand , is vastly different . <p> George Lucas understood this in Star Wars . The Wachowski Brothers understood this in The Matrix . And James Cameron understood this in Avatar . Archetypal Characters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something more than character development . Characters like these translate seamlessly into any culture and are a quick get for any audience . The farther away characterization moves from the obvious , the harder it is for an author to communicate where his or her characters are coming from . Their motivations are less clear . <p> Why cant we have both ? Why cant there be awesome spectacle and complex character development ? Because the currently accepted feature-film length of two hours simply can not support it . You might find this in an HBO miniseries , but you wont be able to find it in your local cinema . Archetypal Characters give an author an opportunity to focus on something other than the characters themselves . <h> Establishing The Goals <p> Before addressing the characters in both films from an objective standpoint ( which is what Archetypal Characters are ) , it becomes necessary to determine what the goal of each story is . In Star Wars , contrary to popular belief , the goal of the story is not to destroy the Death Star . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight the Empire . If the Rebels cant find a way to stand up to them , theyll be forced to live their lives under tyranny . Thankfully , to the people living in that galaxy far , far away , they succeeded . <p> In Avatar , the goal of the story is to save Pandora from corporate destruction . If the NaVi ca n't find a way to stop their aggressors , their planet will transform from a vibrant paradise into a desolate mining operation . <p> Archetypal Characters are defined by their motivations in regards to the Story Goal . The Protagonist is motivated to pursue this goal and to consider the pros and cons of achieving that goal . Both Jake Sully in Avatar and Luke Skywalker in Star Wars exemplify this definition and understanding of characters and their relation to plot . <p> But what about the others ? <h> Weve Seen This All Before <p> In Avatar , the character everyone seems to criticize the most when it comes to being too overly simplistic is Colonel Miles Quaritch ( Stephen Lang ) . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost comes off like a cartoon version of an evil Space Marine . But cant the same be said about Grand Moff Tarkin ( Peter Cusing ) in Star Wars ? From an objective context , both Miles and Moff serve the same dramatic function as the classic Antagonist . <p> Dynamically opposed to the Protagonist , the Antagonist in a story is driven to prevent the goal from being reached , and to get other characters in the story to reconsider their efforts towards achieving that goal . Quaritchs whole purpose in the story is to destroy Pandora and its natives , and to force Jake to reconsider what team he is playing for . There is nothing else the structure calls for him to do , and thus , he fulfills that role quite adequately . <p> In Star Wars , the Empire , personified by Grand Moff Tarkin ( Peter Cushing ) , does the same exact thing . He works at every turn to prevent Luke and the Rebels from uprising , and takes every chance he can to get them to reconsider their rebellious naturewhether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy Leias home world of Alderaan . <p> There is nothing more sophisticated about the Star Wars version than there is about the Avatar version when it comes to the Antagonist . While it might be easy to laugh at Quaritch and his over-the-top Space Marine characterization , Tarkin and his over-the-top Space Nazi characterization provides the same amount of deep thoughtful characterization . They both serve the same dramatic function in their respective stories . <p> This same similarity in character motivation exists between corporate stooge Parker Selfridge ( Giovanni Ribisi ) and the black knight Darth Vader . Both of these characters fulfill the Archetypal Character role of Contagonist . Contagonist is a dramatic concept unique to the Dramatica theory of story , providing the counterpoint to the more familiar Guardian character . <p> The Contagonist in a story is driven to hinder the goal from being reached , while also providing a source of temptation . Parker and his obsession with Unobtanium represents corporate greed in Avatar , and thus exemplifies the kind of problems created by someone driven by temptation . In addition , he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pandora by shutting down the Avatar program and by looking the other way when needed . His character may seem vapid , but the function he is delivering is solid . <p> Many erroneously consider Darth Vader the Antagonist or " Villain " of Star Wars . While on the surface this may seem to be true , it is important to evaluate character motivation in the context of the Story Goal . Darth does nothing to prevent the rebels from fighting the Empire , at least not until the end in the trench scene . Up until then , though , he does an awful lot of hinderingagainst the Rebels by hiding a homing beacon on the Falcon and even against the Empire itself when he chokes out Upper Management on the Death Star . It is clear , too , that he represents a source of temptation in the storysomeone who has given in to the temptations of the Dark Side of the Force . <p> Both Darth and Parker play the same objective character role . There is nothing deeper to them than their desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But does Darth receive the same amount of ridicule that Camerons Parker sometimes endures ? Of course not . That leather-clad baddie with the light sword has become such a part of the collective subconscious that he easily escapes online disparagement . <p> There are other duplicate characters throughout both films . Tsutey ( Laz Alonzo ) , Neytiris original boyfriend , plays the same Skeptic role that Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ) assumed in Star Wars . Both were driven by their disbelief , either in Jakes abilities or in the Force itself . And both were motivated to oppose their respective Protagonists efforts . <p> Now , it is true that Han Solo participates in his own sub-story within the greater context of Star Wars , and it is this deeper insight into his character that makes him seem fuller and more well developed than the jealous blue-boyfriend of Avatar . But in the greater context of the main story between Rebels and Empire , there is really nothing more to Han than the guy who speaks out against things and refuses to chip in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Ben Kenobi ( Alec Guiness ) played the same character , that of the Guardian character . In contrast to their opposing Contagonists , both Grace and Ben were driven to help the Protagonist by providing a voice of conscience . As with Han , Ben had a significantly more important role within the overall structure of Star Wars ( that of Impact Character ) , but again , in the context of character motivations in relation to the Story Goal , both are one and the same . <p> Same objective role , same simple character , same dramatic device . <h> Characterization Gives Way to Entertainment <p> Could the storytelling of Avatar been improved ? Certainly . But the way a story is told is separate from how a story is structured . Storytelling deals with dialogue and character description . Story structure centers around character motivation and justification . Could the criticism towards the storytelling in Avatar be justified ? Possibly . But is there a problem with how simple the character motivations are ? Not unless you thought there was a problem with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Star Wars were populated by the same simple Archetypal Characters . From Antagonist to Contagonist , Skeptic to Guardian , the exploration of character in both films was kept to a minimum as to provide as much screen time as possible for space explosions and Marine hovercraft . If more time had been devoted to character development and complex characterization , the spectacle would have been far less spectacular . In both cases . <p> But spectacle was the purpose of Avatar , as it was for Star Wars some thirty years ago . <p> In 1977 , audiences did n't  have access to Twitter , Facebook , story structure blogs ( ! ) or any of the other countless sources of story knowledge we now take for granted . If they did , than perhaps the same level of harsh criticism might have been launched towards that seminal sci-fi action flick . Instead , audiences of the 70s saw that film , loved it , and watched it over and over and over again . They did n't  post snarky videos about how weak the characters were or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They simply watched the film , embraced it and allowed it to become a source of inspiration in their lives . The end result was that filmmaking was changed forever . <p> It is clear now that Avatar will have the same effect on the next generation of filmmakers . Back in December , when the film first premiered , the question was whether or not todays audiences are too progressive , too well-informed to embrace a story based on Archetypal Characters . Five months later , in spite of all the criticism leveled at the story , the overwhelming positive response to this movie can not be ignored . Kids ( and grown-up kids ) today love this film just as much as kids in the 70s loved Star Wars . <p> Among the older generations , Avatar will become the film they love to hate . It will have to be seen whether or not a greater understanding of the mechanics of story structure will somehow allow them to look on Avatar with different eyes .

@@119272690 @8272690/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Archetypes and the Hero 's Journey <p> By far , the most useless aspect of the Heros Journey mono-myth lies with the concept of the character archetype . The Shapeshifter , the Trickster , the Threshold Guardianwhile romantically named , prove ultimately worthless to the working writer . <p> On the other hand , Archetypal Characters as defined by the Dramatica theory of story prove extremely beneficial . Here , characters are seen as functions , completely devoid of their relationship to the " hero " of a story . Protagonists pursue goals and Antagonists prevent them . Guardians help while Contagonists get in the way . <p> The Hero is nowhere to be found . <p> While there are some similarities between the two ways of looking at story , the mono-myth approach falls well short of defining all the archetypes present in a complete story . The following is a comparison of the two paradigms and the relative usefulness of each . It assumes you have a working knowledge of the Dramatica Archetypes . <p> First , let 's start with the Campbell archetypes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Heros function is to serve and sacrifice . <p> Dramatica equivalent : Protagonist - the Protagonists function is to pursue the goal of the story . There are no moral implications associated with this function ; the goal could be noble , it could be despicable . All that matters is that this character is the one pushing the effort towards the goal . " Restore order " could be interpreted as solving the storys problem , but again " order " implies some sort of assumed preference to things being orderly ( sometimes chaos is the thing that can solve a storys problem ) . The concept of Hero is identified as the character who is both Protagonist and Main Character . The two are not automatically the same . <h> Mentor <p> Campbell : The Mentors function is to guide . <p> Dramatica equivalent : Guardian - the Guardians function is to teach or help , and represents conscience . This one is pretty similar , although its important to point out that the Campbell version assumes the Mentor is guiding the Hero of the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matters is that they objectively represent that function . <h> Shadow <p> Campbell : The Shadows function is to destroy . <p> Dramatica equivalent : Antagonist - the Antagonists function is to prevent the goal of the story from being met . This too is pretty similar , but the idea that they have to " destroy " can be limiting to some writers . <h> Ally <p> Campbell : The Allys function is to assist . <p> Dramatica equivalent : Sidekick - the Sidekicks function is to show faithful support . Again , the same . <h> Shapeshifter <p> Campbell : The Shapeshifters function is to question and deceive . <p> Dramatica equivalent : While the deceiving part sounds closer to Contagonist , the idea that this character is supposed to supply " doubt " in a story implies that this character is the Skeptic - the Skeptics function is to be the disbeliever - the cynical one who opposes efforts towards the goal . <h> Trickster <p> Campbell : The Tricksters function is to disrupt . <p> Dramatica equivalent : The closest thing would be the Contagonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts towards the goal . In addition and in opposition to the Guardians function , the Contagonist represents temptation . <p> But this is where the similarities cease and Campbells archetypes begin to break down in terms of their objective usefulness . <h> Threshold Guardian and Herald <p> Campbell : The Threshold Guardians function is to test . The Heralds function is to warn and challenge . <p> Dramatica equivalent : There is no equivalent . Campbell sees both the Threshold Guardian and the Herald as characters responsible for driving the story forward . In the case of the TG , the hero must meet and overcome him in order to commit himself to his quest . In other words he turns Act 1 to Act 2 . That 's a lot of responsibility for one character . Its also extremely limiting creatively . <p> The concept of the Herald is even more egregious . This poor character has the major responsibility of issuing the " challenge " to the Main Character to embark on the journey in the first place . Proponents of Campbells theory are quick to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you really shouldnt have to bend a theory in order to make it work . <p> Act turns should not be tied to any one character . Not only is it limiting in terms of a writers creativity , it does n't  even make sense . The development of a storys problem progresses along the competing throughlines ( the main plot , the Main Characters throughline , etc. ) based on the kind of drivers established at the beginning of a storys problems . <h> Logic and Emotion <p> The most interesting aspect of this whole study is the fact that Campbell is leaving out two very important archetypes - the Reason archetype and the Emotion archetype . Interestingly enough , most stories that follow the monomyth paradigm find a way to blend the elements of Reason and Emotion into the Hero or any one of the Allies attached to him or her . <h> The Usefulness of Any Archetype <p> Regardless of which paradigm is followed , stories that use Archetypal Characters often fall flat in the character department . Star Wars and Contact are not textbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you get . But what they can do is give an author a starting point or shorthand to get them rolling towards whatever it was that excited them about writing in the first place . I suspect George Lucas was more interested in battling light swords than he was the subtle intricacies of character motivation . <p> Clearly though , one approach is superior and far more succinct in its examination of what constitutes a complete story . Archetypal Characters , as defined by Dramatica , are seen as a collection of complimentary elements that work in tandem to provide an example of one way of solving the storys central problem . They are defined not by their relation to the Hero , but by their function within the story and thus , are not confined by one narrow view of what stands for a great story . 
@@119272691 @8272691/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Transforming Real Life into a Story <h> Turning the events of our lives into meaningful narrative requires an understanding of how our minds operate . <p> If Dramatica is a theory of story based on the psychology of the human mind , then it only follows that that very same model can be used to understand the narratives of our own lives . Real life can seem pointless at times , meaningless within the chaos of living day-to-day . Crafting a narrative gives context to the conflict , and offers meaning to our own experience . <p> Stephen R. Coveys quote " We see the world , not as it is , but as we are " is more reality than a truth because of the way our minds think . Externally we see Mass , Energy , Space , and Time because internally our minds consist of Knowledge , Thought , Ability , and Desire . <p> The four dimensions of the outer world Mass , Energy , Space , and Time are reflected by the four dimensions of the inner world Knowledge , Thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set is a reflection of the other with neither being the origin . Existence can not be understood wholly from either a material or immaterial perspective . Perception is required to enable existence , and vice versa . <p> Pretty heady stuff , but important to comprehend when it comes to transforming the events of our lives into a meaningful story . We see the outer world because of our inner world . There could very well be something more than Mass , Energy , Space , and Time Out there but we will never knowwe only have Knowledge , Thought , Ability , and Desire to see them . <p> That limitation , however , defines how we appreciate and understand and give meaning to the events in our lives . Transforming real live events into a story simply requires assigning contexts to those events and applying them to the Dramatica model . <h> The Search for Something More <p> Take , for instance , the recent dramatization of Eddie " The Eagle " Edwards and his personal journey to the 1998 Olympics in Calgary in the recent film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film earlier this week , I was surprised to discover that the Hugh Jackman character in the film , Edwards personal coach Bronson Peary , was completely made up . The filmmakers , accomplished and as experienced as they were , understood that without a proper Influence Character the film would flounder . <p> In order to grow , Edwards needs a competing point-of-view to challenge and influence him to dig his heels in and stand his ground . This resoluteness , or Steadfast Main Character behavior , requires the presence of another world paradigm that changes because of that steadfast attitude . Casting Jackman as the down-in-out drunken has-been who eventually proves himself to his disappointed coach fulfills that necessary role and gives meaning to those real-world events . <h> Meaning <p> Meaning is a key word in this discussion and something that does n't  come up quite often when discussing what really happened . As cynical as it may seem to say , real life has no meaning.1 I used to jokingly tell my CalArts students this every yearpartly as a means of beating them downbut mainly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about story . <p> A functional narrative gives meaning to made-up imaginary events . A functional real-world narrative must also give meaningbut to events that have no inherent meaning . Doing this requires settings those events into a context for a narrative . <p> Edwards personal struggles with his disability growing up and his lack of a skiers physique was clearly the Main Character Throughline . The struggle to compete with other skiers more experienced and more skilled than him was clearly the Overall Story Throughline as everyone faced this conflict . For many this would be enough . Tell the story of this kid with a dream who finally saw it through . <h> The Difference Between a Tale and a Story <p> Unfortunately , taking that approach would n't bring any meaning to the Audience beyond the fact that he did it . You could start the story later on in his life , just before the competition , or anywhere in-between and the meaning would be the same . The only way it could possibly mean something different is if you did n't  show whether or not he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards this way would have resulted in a Tale . Here at Narrative First , and to most familiar with the Dramatica theory of story , the tale is less than a story . The tale says this happened , then this happened , and then this happened . End of story ( well , reallytale ) . <p> A complete story , or as Dramatica refers to it as a Grand Argument Story , says that for all situations and circumstances where this problem comes up , the solution provided is the very best way to resolve conflict . Tales work fine in that one isolated incident . Stories manufacture an argument to an Audience an inspire them to use said resolution in their own lives . <p> This is precisely the purpose behind Eddie the Eagle and any number of biopics that hope to inspire drive , commitment , and persistence with the events of their subjects . <p> The Main Character Throughline and the Overall Story Throughline represent only one-half of the argument needed in a fully functional complete story . To merely rely on these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument : it works , as long as you do n't  bring up any counter-arguments . To balance out those points-of-view a complete story requires an Influence Character Throughline and a Relationship Story Throughline . The former offers the Main Character a competing point-of-view regarding how to best solve the storys central problem . The latter offers a counter to the conflict in the Overall Story by showing the Audience what those problems look like in a more intimate situation between two people . <p> The filmmakers behind Eddie the Eagle understood this instinctively and thus , created the story of Bronson Peary , his fall from grace , and his eventual rebirth through his interactions with Edwards . Clearly , Edwards was not going to change his point-of-view . He needed someone else who would . <h> The Change of Point-Of-View and What It Means <p> When we speak about the meaning of a narrative , we speak of who changes their point-of-view and what results from that change , both logistically and emotionally . Three story points from the Dramatica theory of story carry this basic message : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes their paradigm , and who remains steadfast to their belief system <p> Story Outcome : let 's the Audience know if things worked out in success , or if they failed <p> Story Judgment : grants an emotional judgment of how things turned outwas it all a good thing or a bad thing ? <p> By combining these three Story Points together , the Author of a narrative builds the basis for their Grand Argument . The Main Character Resolve tells us which point-of-view won and the Story Outcome and the Story Judgment tells us what happens when that point-of-view wins . <p> Along comes space wizard Obi Wan Kenobi who basically tells Luke that everything and everyone remains unproven . You never know what can happen . This point-of-view challenges Lukes and the two go back and forth on which one is best . <p> Eventually Obi Wans perspective wins and Luke changes his resolve . The result is that the Rebels find a way to fight back against the Empire ( a Successful Story Outcome ) and Luke and everyone else feels great about how it all worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original Star Wars argues that an approach of anything can happen is better , or more appropriate , than an approach of constantly testing your mettle . You will win if you think everything is unproven and you will feel great about doing so .

@@119272692 @8272692/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Why The Main Character 's Approach <p> Main Characters make decisions and they take actions . They engage in deliberation and they get things done . Yet for some reason , Narrative Science seemingly requires both Analysts and Authors to force their Main Characters into choosing one or the other . <p> Referred to in Dramatica ( the first version of Narrative Science ) as the Main Characters Approach , this story point files the great characters of literature and the silver screen into two boxes : Do-ers or Be-ers . The former act first then ask questions later , while the latter first internalize before then making their move . Limiting and reductive at first glance , the reason for this determination lies in a better appreciation of the minds problem-solving process and its place within the structure of a compelling and meaningful story . <h> A Place to Begin <p> Functioning stories exist as models of human psychologyin particular , the process of problem-solving . One of the first steps to take when solving a problem lies in determining exactly where to place ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world around me or should I try to change myself ? Answering this question initiates the process of problem-solving . Ignoring it ignites the process of justification ( or hiding the problem from ourselves ) . <p> Problems do n't  exist outside of us , nor do they exist within usrather , they exist in the area between us and our environment . Because we cant address that inequity directly , we must focus our efforts on one area or the otherthus , the Main Characters Approach . <p> When faced with internal issues we focus on ourselves . When faced with external issues we focus on our environment . Why ? Finding internal solutions for internal problems is much easier than searching for external ones . Likewise , exploring external solutions for problems within the external environment becomes a much easier task than searching for an internal one . <p> This Approach often shows itself as a preference on behalf of the Main Character . Do-ers prefer to do the work outside , Be-ers prefer to do the work inside . <h> The Path of Least Resistance <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of affairs or an external activity will approach their problem first by taking action . As a poor playwright with nothing to show for his efforts , William Shakespeare ( Joseph Fiennes ) searches externally for a new muse in Shakespeare in Love . Hogarth Hughes ( Eli Marienthal ) from The Iron Giant seeks adventure and action from a life that has neither . <p> Conversely , a Main Character experiencing personal issues emanating from an internal attitude or dysfunctional way of thinking will approach their problem first by modifying their behavior . Sully ( John Goodman ) from Monsters , Inc. finds his greatest assetfrightto be a behavior in need of change if he is to ever grow closer to Boo . Meanwhile " Deanie " Loomis ( Natalie Wood ) from Splendor in the Grass attempts to re-wire her behavioreven going so far as to accept institutionalizationin order to keep from slipping further into madness . <p> In each of these cases , the Main Character approaches their personal problem by first taking that path of least resistance . External takes external , internal takes internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Characters Approach can be used to identify the source of that central characters personal problem as well as their response to it . <h> Assuming the Right Perspective <p> Key to pinpointing the source of these personal problems remains an accurate account of point-of-view . Are we taking a first person perspective or are we looking at it from a distance ? Is the inattentive parent on the bus letting their child run rampant out of neglect , or is it because theyve just received devastating news that they 're to raise the child on their own ? One cant cant asses inequity without first taking into account perspective . <p> Same with story . <p> The examples of story given above focus on the issues facing each of those Main Characters personally . They may have other concerns within the larger picture or within other relationships , but when it comes down to dealing with my problems , and what am I facing ( as required by the Main Character perspective ) that first-person point-of-view becomes all important . <h> Creating a Mind for the Audience <p> It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story . The concept of Main Character Approach certainly allows for well-rounded characters exhibiting both qualities . But the end-game ca n't become a quest to capture down on paper " real people " . <p> Approach plays out as a preference because stories do not replicate real life . Rather , stories exist as constructs designed to communicate meaning by creating a " mind " for the Audience to possess . The Main Character represents the first-person perspective of this mind and thus , from that point-of-view sees the problem as being either internal or external ( because it cant see that true problem in-between the two ) . Taking the path of least resistance this story-mind approaches that problem by tackling external problems with actions and internal ones with behavior modification . <p> Why then ask for the Main Characters Approach during the course of crafting a story ? In answering that question , one can help solidify the Audiences position within the mind of a story while simultaneously granting clues as to the work and effort put forth by the Main Character to resolve their personal issues . 
@@119272694 @8272694/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Understanding Dramatica 's Complex Terminology Made Easier <p> Complex story theory without the complicationsis it even possible ? With vocabulary rivaling even the most obscure foreign language dictionary , the Dramatica theory of story scares off many candidates . The key lies in understanding the importance of assessing the proper context . <p> When it comes to incorporating Dramatica into their workflow , many writers trip themselves up when it comes to the terminology . Forewarnings and Goals ring familiar , but terms like Prerequisites and Preconditions send many running for the hills . Even when it comes to the basic building blocks of a throughlineDomain , Concern , Issue and Problemwriters overcomplicate their illustration by failing to see the terms for what they are : different lenses on the same thing . <h> Why Throughlines Exist <p> Every complete story presents an audience four Throughlines . Distinctly different , yet subtly similar in some respects , these story lines encapsulate the conflict at the heart of the story . The Main Character Throughline grants us an intimate personal look . The Influence Character Throughline presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Relationship Story Throughline clues us in on the conflict between these two characters . Finally , the Overall Story Throughline covers the dissonance between all the characters ( Main and Influence included ) . <p> When granted all these throughlines the audience gains insight into a particular problem without the bias that comes from only taking a singular point-of-view . It may seem that the Main Character of a story makes all the wrong decisions and takes all the wrong actions from a distant point-of-view , but dive in and walk a mile in his or her shoes ( by exploring their personal throughline ) and you may come away with a different understanding . The Throughlines exist to give the receiver of a story greater perspective . <h> Every Level a Problem <p> Understanding the importance of these disparate points-of-view and their function as a perspective on the same conflict makes it easier to appreciate the somewhat complex terminology found in each . The Domain , Concern , Issue , and Problem of a throughline act as different size lenses for the conflict at hand . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " problem " for Domain , Concern and Issue and still come out alright . <p> The Domain showcases the grandest view of the problem . Is it internal or external ? Is it static or a process ? That 's it . The combined answer to those two questions gives us the widest scope from which to view the problem . Static external problems find themselves in the Situation Domain . Static internal problems operate within the Fixed Attitude Domain . External processes ? Those problems lie in the Actitivity Domain while internal processes find a home in the Way of Thinking or Manipulation Domain . Regardless of their location , the Throughlines Domain still simply reflects the problem , just in a broader general sense . <p> Take one step down the chart and you 'll find the lens ratchet up a few stops . Moving from generality to a more specific view , the Concern isolates what Type of problem we are looking at . We still observe the same thing , only now we refine our focus . Those fixed external problemsdo they have to do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How Things are Changing ? When looking at those external processes that cause problems do we see Doing , Obtaining , Learning or a Understanding to be a more detailed explanation of what is going on ? <p> Note how the four Types fit nicely into the Domain above them . This happens throughout the entire Dramatica Table of Story Elements : the set of four items below describe the item above . Memories , Impulsive Responses , Innermost Desires and Contemplations depict Fixed Attitudes . Developing a Plan , Playing a Role , Changing Ones Nature and Conceiving an Idea represent a dysfunctional Way of Thinking . <p> The next level down increases our magnification ever more , focusing our attention on the Issues at hand . This level reflects the thematic point of study for the Throughline . Harmonizing this Issue with its dynamically opposed ( diagonal ) Counterpoint provides an Author the tools necessary to measure the relative value of compensations for the central problem . Guess what ? Despite all that heady theoretical thematic mumbo-jumbo , the Issue still describes a problem . Sure , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general sense , but it still sheds light by describing the problem . <p> Finally at the bottom , we reach the actual Problem . Or have we ? It may be labeled " Problem " , but is it still the Problem ? Remember that each Throughline acts as a lens and as such , distorts the original image . We can never really see the original Problemthe inequity at the center of it allbecause one cant describe it . <p> If they could , there would be no need for stories . <p> The Problem at the bottom of a Throughline reports that Throughlines version of the actual original problem . Granted , the level of detail at this level elevates its accuracy of depiction far beyond that of simply describing the Domain , yet it still merely represents the greatest magnification of the same thing . <h> Simplifying Structure <p> Instead of beating your head against the wall trying to figure out what the difference is between a Domain or a Concern or an Issue , consider this : they 're all the same thing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small ( or if you want to be technically accurate , label them Biggest , Big , Medium and Small ) . By understanding what they represent one can more easily integrate how they function within a story . <p> Dramatica is a giant problem machine . Seeing every level as simply varying degrees of magnification of conflict renders the apparatus more approachable and grants Authors the opportunity to really get to the heart of their stories .

One will be dealing with issues externally , the other internally . In other words , if what the Main Character is dealing with is some internal issue like an empty heart , the Influence Character will be dealing with some kind of predicament . Think Scrooge and Marley from A Christmas Carol . Scrooge is heartless and Marley is forced to wear those chains . One is an internal problem , the other external . <p> The reverse is also true .

Act turns are not time markers . <h> Causation and Act Turns <p> This technique of using causation to determine the Inciting Incident of a story though appears best in the example of The Fugitive . Referring again to the original post , Bird claims that both the murder of Richards wife and the train wreck itself function as the collective Inciting Incident of the story . If this were true , what decisions do these events force into existence ? Remember that the creation of an inequity , in effect , creates a vacuum that necessitates some response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incited the problem into existence they would force decisions . <p> They do n't  . <p> The murder of Richards wife did n't  come out of nowherethere was a reason . Contrast this with Buffalo Bills heinous act . There was no prior decision that forced that serial killer into killing that fifth girl , the action itself created the inequity . In The Fugitive , the initial murder did n't  create the vacuum , it came as a response to the inequity created by another important decision . <p> The one-armed man killed Kimbles wife because her husband , Dr. Richard Kimball , made the decision to blow the whistle on RDU-90 . <h> The Story Driver Test <p> The best test to determine what is truly driving a story , or creating the inequities within a complete story , is to ask this question ( source ) : <p> If " x " had not happened , is it likely that " y " would have happened anyways ? If the answer is yes , then x is NOT driving the story forward . If the answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Note that an answer of no does not guarantee that x is the event driving the story . To confidently say that , one needs to examine all the turning points within a story and determine the commonality behind all those events . In a complete story , all the xs will either be actions or decisions . They wont be a mixture of both . ( The Advanced Theory section of this article has more on why ) . <h> The Drivers of the Lambs <p> With Silence one would ask , if Buffalo Bill had not killed his fifth victim , is it likely that they would have decided to go with Lecter ? Probably not . Now we have a potential candidate for an action-driven story . The key is to examine other events that drive a story and see what they bring up . <p> If Miggs had not attacked Clarice , is it likely that Lecter would have made the decision to help her ? No . Candidate number two . If Lecter had n't  left the writing on the map would Clarice have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the moth had n't  landed on the spools of thread in Gumbs house would she have made the decision to try and arrest him . No , and again , another candidate . <p> This continues on and on until the end of the story when Clarice shoots Gumb . The inequity created by the initial Inciting Incidentthat of Gumb getting his fifth killhas been successfully resolved . This Concluding Event always clarifies the resolution the original inequity . <p> Luckily for those involved in this story , it has . <h> The Drivers of The Fugitive <p> This same test can works with Kimball and friends . If Kimball had not decided to reveal his discovery of RUD90 , is it likely that his wife would have been killed ? No way , no how . A clear indication of a decision creating an inequity . <p> But as with Lambs , it becomes important to check the findings against other driving events and see if they are decisions as well . <p> Take for instance the train wreck . Everyone can agree that this sequence turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man sentenced to death , Second Act : convicted fugitive on the loose . But is it the train wreck that forces further decisions , or was there some decision that brought about that spectacular crash ? <p> It would be difficult to conclusively determine what decisions the wreck brought about . One could try and argue that Richard decides to run away , but a ) its less of a decision and more of a gut reaction for survival , and b ) it would lack any meaningful connection between the drivers of a story and the problems they create . Causation is the key here , and it is n't strong enough to warrant the label of Act turner . <h> Developing a Storys Problems <p> In The Fugitive , problems arise when characters try to help others . His wifes call for help ( which is misunderstood as an attempt to identify him ) , Kimballs attempt to help the injured child ( which almost ends in his own apprehension ) , and the cops in the chopper trying to aid Gerard ( which almost kill him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others create and develop the inequity of the story . The most important example though , at least for this article , is when the corrections officer decides to open up the gate in order to aid the convulsing prisoner . <p> This is the decision that led to the train wreck . This is the First Act Turn . <p> Note the amount of attention paid to his indecision , to the yelling and the screaming for the officer to make a choice . This is a significant meaningful moment , developing the storys original inequity and pushing it towards the end . If the officer had not decided to open the gate , would there have been a train wreck ? Would there have even been an Act Two ? <p> No way . <h> Connecting the Inciting Incident to Meaning <p> There is a meaningful pattern to the types of events that drive a story . They are not simply things that divide a story into convenient-sized quarters . While these turning points are often found at the same time mark ( 30 pages into a 120-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page markers do not function well as a basis for determining Act breaks . <p> Separating the Inciting Incident from the Main Characters storyline is key . The Main Character has their own personal issues to deal with . They tie in thematically with the larger story , and perhaps could have their own inciting event , but they are unique and personal to the central character of a story . The central character , however , is not the entire story . <p> This distinction is an important one to make if there are accurate conversations to be had over what is going on within a complete story . Mashing up the Inciting Incident into an event that covers both the start of the Main Characters story and the part of the story that concerns everyone else is a guaranteed way to incite confusion over whether or not the Main Character experiences a paradigm shift , and whether or not they truly transform . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Why all the focus on actions and decisions ?

With this revelation , the " Inciting Incident " , the " Break into Two " and " Break into Three " and the " Concluding Event " suddenly have meaning beyond tabbed folders in an outline . <p> Dramatica refers to these key moments as Story Drivers . A story can be either Action-driven or Decision-driven , but not both . As covered in Consistent Plot Points , a meaningful argument exists when the Author maintains the pattern of causation they began with that first Inciting Incident . A story that starts with an Decision cant end with a Action . It simply does n't  make sense . ( See Bee Movie ) . <p> Actions drive The Silence of the Lambs . Decision drive The Fugitive . Re-reading the article above , one can see that the events that begin a story and drive it from one Act to the next are not simply things that happen ( as plot is so often described ) , but rather events that force other events to transpire . Action-driven stories will force decisions . Decision-driven stories will force actions .

With vocabulary rivaling even the most obscure foreign language dictionary , the Dramatica theory of story scares off many candidates . The key lies in understanding the importance of assessing the proper context . <p> When it comes to incorporating Dramatica into their workflow , many writers trip themselves up when it comes to the terminology . Forewarnings and Goals ring familiar , but terms like Prerequisites and Preconditions send many running for the hills . Even when it comes to the basic building blocks of a throughlineDomain , Concern , Issue and Problemwriters overcomplicate their illustration by failing to see the terms for what they are : different lenses on the same thing . <h> Why Throughlines Exist <p> Every complete story presents an audience four Throughlines . Distinctly different , yet subtly similar in some respects , these story lines encapsulate the conflict at the heart of the story . The Main Character Throughline grants us an intimate personal look . The Influence Character Throughline presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Relationship Story Throughline clues us in on the conflict between these two characters . Finally , the Overall Story Throughline covers the dissonance between all the characters ( Main and Influence included ) . <p> When granted all these throughlines the audience gains insight into a particular problem without the bias that comes from only taking a singular point-of-view . It may seem that the Main Character of a story makes all the wrong decisions and takes all the wrong actions from a distant point-of-view , but dive in and walk a mile in his or her shoes ( by exploring their personal throughline ) and you may come away with a different understanding . The Throughlines exist to give the receiver of a story greater perspective . <h> Every Level a Problem <p> Understanding the importance of these disparate points-of-view and their function as a perspective on the same conflict makes it easier to appreciate the somewhat complex terminology found in each . The Domain , Concern , Issue , and Problem of a throughline act as different size lenses for the conflict at hand . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " problem " for Domain , Concern and Issue and still come out alright . <p> The Domain showcases the grandest view of the problem . Is it internal or external ? Is it static or a process ? That 's it . The combined answer to those two questions gives us the widest scope from which to view the problem . Static external problems find themselves in the Situation Domain . Static internal problems operate within the Fixed Attitude Domain . External processes ? Those problems lie in the Actitivity Domain while internal processes find a home in the Way of Thinking or Manipulation Domain . Regardless of their location , the Throughlines Domain still simply reflects the problem , just in a broader general sense . <p> Take one step down the chart and you 'll find the lens ratchet up a few stops . Moving from generality to a more specific view , the Concern isolates what Type of problem we are looking at . We still observe the same thing , only now we refine our focus .

When looking at those external processes that cause problems do we see Doing , Obtaining , Learning or a Understanding to be a more detailed explanation of what is going on ? <p> Note how the four Types fit nicely into the Domain above them .

Memories , Impulsive Responses , Innermost Desires and Contemplations depict Fixed Attitudes . Developing a Plan , Playing a Role , Changing Ones Nature and Conceiving an Idea represent a dysfunctional Way of Thinking . <p> The next level down increases our magnification ever more , focusing our attention on the Issues at hand . This level reflects the thematic point of study for the Throughline . Harmonizing this Issue with its dynamically opposed ( diagonal ) Counterpoint provides an Author the tools necessary to measure the relative value of compensations for the central problem . Guess what ? Despite all that heady theoretical thematic mumbo-jumbo , the Issue still describes a problem . Sure , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general sense , but it still sheds light by describing the problem . <p> Finally at the bottom , we reach the actual Problem . Or have we ?

We can never really see the original Problemthe inequity at the center of it allbecause one cant describe it . <p> If they could , there would be no need for stories . <p> The Problem at the bottom of a Throughline reports that Throughlines version of the actual original problem . Granted , the level of detail at this level elevates its accuracy of depiction far beyond that of simply describing the Domain , yet it still merely represents the greatest magnification of the same thing . <h> Simplifying Structure <p> Instead of beating your head against the wall trying to figure out what the difference is between a Domain or a Concern or an Issue , consider this : they 're all the same thing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small ( or if you want to be technically accurate , label them Biggest , Big , Medium and Small ) .

They often know how they want to start things out , and theyve usually got a great idea for a killer ending , but when it comes to all that stuff in the Middle , they can find themselves feeling a bit lost or confused . How do they keep the energy level up for such an extended period of time ? <p> Syd Field made things easier with his recognition of the Midpoint , an event that happens directly in the middle of a screenplay .

What a better way to celebrate terror than with a film that is arguably the Summers first-ever blockbuster hit . <p> But does it rate story-wise ? <p> While the film is expertly told , it does lack the thematic complexity of say , Hamlet or Amadeus . The shark certainly forces Brody to deal with his personal issues , but is hardly the kind of character the Sheriff can develop a meaningful relationship with , one he can battle on a subjective level . Thus , no real emotional argument is made and the film comes up just short of claiming the label of a complete story . <p> That being said , the purpose of Jaws was to entertain and excite and almost certainly , terrify . For that it was extremely successful ( at least in the mid-70s ) , and whether or not it was told completely pales in comparison to its undeniable success . When all is said and done , Jaws tells the simple story of a man who overcomes his fear of water by having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it than that . <p> What it does provide , however , is an excellent example of how the problem-solving process moves through four separate Acts . <h> Plot Points <p> Picking up on last weeks article regarding Plot Points and the Inciting Incident , it is easy to see the partitions separating each Act . The Inciting Incident of Jaws comes with the brutal devouring of " Chrissie " Watkins . That first attack upsets the balance of things in Amityville , thus creating the need for a story . Destroying the shark resolves the problem and ends the story . The three Plot Points between these events amplify the original problem , increasing the inequity caused by the Inciting Incident while simulatenously shifting the focus of the story . <p> What is most interesting about this is not so much how the Plot Points divide the story up equally , as it is about how these events shift the dramatic focus of the film and the intentions of the characters into a new and as of yet , uncharted area . The Plot Points are more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a changing of the tide and a call for new growth . <h> Development of Character <p> As mentioned previously , Sheriff Brody ( Roy Scheider ) has a personal issue with going into the waterhes terrified of it . He spends a good portion of the story avoiding this fear , doing whatever he can to keep from facing it regardless of the problems it creates for him and those around him . The story , and the Plot Points that propel it forward , move Brody to a point where he can finally overcome that fear by having to face them head-on . <p> Driven by this fear , Brody takes several approaches to dealing with this problem externally . His approach changes with each Act Turn , as it should in response to the shifting dramatic tides going on within the story . <p> It should be noted that the following four stages of approach are NOT in every story , nor do they necessarily reflect accurately what Brody is dealing with personally . The four listed below are merely the different approaches one can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is one way to look at the problem-solving process , however one complete way . The following sequence is simply provided as an example of the natural progression that comes when a writer begins to think in terms of four , rather than three . <h> Preservation <p> Following the awful demise of Chrissie , Brody is forced into protection mode . In this First Act , he endeavors to safeguard the people of Amity from any further attacks . A character stuck in preservation mode wont do anything more or less than what it would take to put things back the way they were , almost as if nothing had happened at all . This is reflected in his efforts to make warning signs and his desire to close the beaches . <p> Only problem is , Amity has a Mayor and several city fathers who would rather see their town thrive as it always has on the 4th of July . <h> Inaction <p> Having failed to resolve the problem with protection , Brody tries doing nothing in the Second Act . Sure , he argues with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the captured tiger shark , but when it comes down to it , he spends most of this Act reamining relatively ineffectual . The Kitner kid gets it and Brody responds by getting drunk on wine . <p> This approach of inaction carries itself up to the apparent third " shark " attack , wherein Brody stands shoreline as dozens and dozens of panicked swimmers rush past him . He ca n't step into the water , cant help anyone and even when the real shark threatens his own son , all he can do is stand by and watch . He does nothing to further or hinder the progress of the problem . <h> Reaction <p> The severed leg of the poor fisherman falls to the ocean floor and Brody has to change his approach yet again . No longer able to hide behind the guise of protecting , and no longer content with standing idly by at the waters edge , Brody spends the majority of the Third Act reacting . This is different from preservation in that , when something negative happens , the reactive person attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things back to an equitable state regardless of source . <p> When Quint destroys the radio , Brody responds by yelling at him , challenging him to the point of being overreactive . If this had been the Brody of the First Act , he would have tried putting the radio back together . If instead this had been the Brody of the previous act , he would n't have done a thing . But he did n't  because this is the Brody of the Third Act ; there is no going back to previous Acts when it comes to character development and plot progression . The human mind does n't  backtrack when solving problems , and neither should a story . <p> Brody moves into this Third Act focused on responding to the shark as his new approach . The reactive person attacks the source of the problem that attacks them , reacting to what has happened . There is no looking forward , and no anticipation . <h> Proaction <p> The shark attacks the boat , chomps down on Quint , and suddenly Brody finds himself propelled into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can when dealing with a killer shark , Brody is left with one final method : Proaction . This is different from Reaction in that a character wontt wait for something negative to happen first , instead they initiate the action . Sheriff Brody does n't  wait for the shark to attack first , as Hooper did in the cage , or as Quint did trying to punch his way free of those massive teeth . <p> Instead , the man who was once afraid of water , grabs the gun , climbs the masthead and tells G.W. to flash those pearly whites . <h> The Completeness of Four Movements <p> It is a natural progression , when trying to determine how to effectively deal with a menacing shark , to move from a point of preservation to inaction to reaction , and finally , to proaction . Whether or not Brodys final shot rang true or not , every tactical aspect of fighting a monster of the sea had been covered . A completely new story would have to be created to further deal with the problem if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brody could have gone . <p> Eagle-eyed storytellers will pick up on the fact that the Act movements in Brodys development do not correspond exactly with their counterparts in the story at large . His first Act lingers until the Kitner kids mom delivers her response and his Third Act lasts forever until Quint meets his bloody end . This is not a mistake . <p> The development of the Main Character does not always sync up precisely with the major Act turns of a story , nor should it . Storytelling is not an exact science ; not every progression can be broken down into four 30-minute sections . Sheriff Brodys development in Jaws is an excellent example of this . <p> It is interesting to note that in Alexandra Sokoloffs analysis of Jaws ( one of the better screenwriting experts out there ) , Brodys slap is identified as the First Act Turning Point . There is a difference between the Plot Points that affect everyone and the Plot Points that affect the Main Character personally . His feels more dramatic and more important because one , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two , the dramatic shift between his First Act and Second is more significant and drastic than the shift that happens in the larger story . <p> Regardless of whether or not one sees the separation between the Main Characters storyline and larger storyline at work ( usually called the A-story ) , Brodys development does proceed in a natural progression of four stages , each one building upon the failures and successes of the previous . <p> There is a feeling of satisfaction , of contentment , that comes with a story that has covered all the dramatic bases . There are no unanswered questions , no story " holes " for audiences to poke their fingers into , and no lingering feeling of dissatisfaction . While Jaws is not a literary masterpiece , it does satisfy the audiences need to have every avenue explored in the context of defeating a killer shark . <p> If Brody had somehow skipped the approach of inaction , as might have happened when thinking of the traditional story paradigm of three acts , there would have been some doubt left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his actions . What if he had n't  done anything ? , they would have asked , and the film would have felt less than satisfying . <p> As it so happens , every approach was covered and the film was a massive success . The progression of Four Acts has much to do with that . <h> Delivering the Message <p> Plot points and the Acts they form are not devices designed to organize storytelling into 30-page increments . Instead , they help form the carrier wave for the message a writer hopes to impart on their audience . Thinking in terms of four Acts , rather than three , insures that the entire message will be delivered intact . <p> The problem with thinking of " the first half of Second Act " and " the second half of the Second Act " is that a writer is in essence saying both halves are dealing with the same thematic elements , both are parts of the same whole , when the truth is they 're not . They are separate , dramatic movements that should be treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of a sophisticated writer . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Pretty much everything in Dramatica is divided up into fours .

The model itself is based on Quad Theorya super complicated mathematical relationship that many writers neednt concern themselves with . Suffice it to say that every structural part of a story can be seen from four different contexts , and the model reflects that . <p> Those who look hard enough will find the quad of Preservation ( now Protection ) , Inaction , Reaction and Proaction under the Issue of Strategy in the Physics Domain . This is NOT the OS Quad and certainly not Brodys MC Quad . It is simply used as a point of reference for looking at Brodys approach or tactics used when dealing with the shark .

Every single time I see it I feel like I 'm witnessing something that should be impossible . <p> I 'm seeing magic . <h> Interlocking Story Points <p> Dramaticas core concept , that of every story acting as an analogy for a single human mind trying to solve a problem , makes this mind-reading a reality . In order to paint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory offers the storyform . As a collection of seventy-five or so thematic story points , the storyform represents a holistic representation of the human mind at work . By showcasing both time and space simultaneously ( with Static Story PointsandDynamic Story Points ) the storyform argues a meaningit argues the Authors message . Many call for form , not formula when speaking of structure . While minds may differ on what they formulate and the conclusions they come to , they all carry the same format . <p> Stories work the same way . <p> Story points do not operate in a vacuum , rather they work together to create that single mind for the Audience to assume . If the Overall Story finds characters concerned with Obtaining something ( either the gold doubloons or stopping a madman on the loose ) , then the emotional core of the story will find the relationship between the two principal characters transforming into something it never was . <p> Formula ? Not really . The internal equivalent of getting something new is simply transforming how we think and a storyas a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal . Without balance , the argument feels skewed and empty . Story holes are holes in the storys argument and the Dramatica storyform makes certain the pieces of the Authors argument interlock in a solid and unbreakable way . <h> I Know What You 're Thinking <p> Understanding then the purpose of Dramaticas storyform one can see how the mind-reading process plays out . The Author selects story points dear to them , perhaps a Triumphant Ending or a Main Character Who is Not the Protagonist , and Dramatica supplies the counter-balance to those choices . Writers can become so caught up in the minutiae of storytelling detaillike the color of a soldiers uniform or the family history of a group of charactersthat they completely forget what it is they 're trying to say . Dramatica keeps them honest and keeps them on track . You want your story to end in Tragedy ? Then you 're gon na need this <p> The magic persists when it comes to analysis . Whether working from the end to find the beginning or setting out to reach the conclusion , the problem-solving process remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dramatica will return what should be there . The feedback returns equal amounts of surprise and confirmation , with the former feeling more like sorcery than computational guessing . <h> When It All Falls Into Place <p> Analyzing a film or story with Dramatica ? Nothing like it . With practice and insight , one can quickly observe and classify the reasons for a storys success ( and unfortunately , sometimes its failures ) . The most difficult task lies in figuring out a storyform that works from all angles . When writing your own work its a simple task to tweak and offset story points to make the storyform work . When analyzing the work of another those story points have already been set in concrete . <p> Dramatica will let you know when you have successfully figured out the form , or mind , of a story . Beyond simply working from all angles , the application will actually surprise you with information about the movie you never entered . It wont simply work , it will conjure up the right answerwithout you even asking ! <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mega-blockbuster *Frozen* proved difficult . While I acknowledge its overwhelming success , I attribute that to more song and relationships than I do the actual story itself.2 The Overall Story lacks any real Consequence and the hand-off of Influence Character from Kristoff to Elsa feels abrupt and ill-timed . Knowing too that the final result was more a culmination of ten years of collaboration and capitulation rather than the singular vision of a driven artist , I was skeptical that any storyform could be found . <p> Imagine my surprise whenafter selecting the story points I believed were reasonably closeDramatica told me that Annas Critcal Flaw should be Attraction.3 <p> A computer program told me that . <p> What is a Critical Flaw in Dramatica terms ? In short , this means that the only thing keeping Anya from solving the storys problem is an over abundance of attractionsound familiar ? Of courseher attraction to Prince Hans . How perfect Is that ? ! <p> Dramatica can do this because it understands story . Like the predictive text in the new version of iOS8 , Dramatica can predict where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all of the other thematicsthe " frozen " situation everyone was in , Annas eventual Steadfastness and a Story Driver of Action ( among many other things ) Annas Critical Flaw had to be Attraction . The filmmakers came to it serendipitously because they all have minds that solve problems the same way . Instinctively , Attraction fit best . How long it took the filmmakers to arrive there is another thing . <p> I 've glimpsed this invocation of wonder countless times . When analyzing Dreamworks How to Train Your Dragon I knew that Stoics problem , and the problem facing everyone , was a refusal to accept dragons and weakling sons . What blew me away was when I went to check out the nature of Hiccups drive and saw that Dramatica says it should be Protection . That described the meekly Viking wonderfully ! In order to combat issues of acceptance , a defensive posture must be taken . That 's what the story was about : Stand up and protect and things will work out . <p> An analysis of A Separation provided the same experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Separation " the selection of the Main Characters Problem allowed Dramatica to work its sleight-of-hand and determine what everyone else in the story would be dealing with : <p> By selecting Cause as Nader 's Main Character Problem , Dramatica took the initiative and calculated the rest of the thematic material needed to tell a compelling story . Yes , that 's right . The power of Dramatica , and its unique ability over any other paradigm of story , lies in its ability to take the parts of your story you know and provide with the bits you have n't even thought of yet . <h> Childlike Wonder <p> How can a computer program predict the necessary thematic elements of a story ? Rather than relying on subjective interpretations of cultural narrative or sequences of beats that bring to mind visions of the Virgin Mary in tortilla chips , Dramatica stakes its claim on the human mind itself . We all instinctively know how to problem-solve . Why not use that process to determine the effectiveness of our stories ? <p> Watching Dramatica predict and illuminate narrative reminds me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I watched in awe as the magician seemingly made things appear out of thin air . I knew it couldnt be real ; magic is make-believe . Yet I still found myself drawn in , caught up in the delight of the experience , and anticipating the surprise and wonder of making something out of nothing . <p> Two decades since its first introduction , the Dramatica theory of story continues to amaze by finding just the right piece for just the right spot . Its extraordinary powers of perception elevate it beyond a simple outliner and make one wonder , like a mind undeterred by cynicism and ego , *perhaps there is real magic after all . ** <p> Most animated films feature a parent/child relationship or some other form of . Other times they depict a love story . Frozen surprises all with its concentration on the relationship between sisterssomething rarely seen in live-action if ever animated . This uniqueness breathes an air of freshness into an otherwise stale medium . ? ?

Performances and cinematography may entrance , but it is the story that locks us in with its rendition of all four major Throughlines . <p> A complete narrative functions as a model of a single human mind problem-solving an iequity . The individual Throughlines offer the Audience an opportunity to see this inequity from all the possible different perspectives . The Main Character Throughline gives us the way in and a chance to feel the conflict personally . The Influence Character Throughline stands in our way and offers an alternative perspective towards resolving the inequity . The Relationship Story Throughline shows us what it is like when we go about resolving inequity . And finally the Overall Story Throughline grants us that objective view of the inequity and the efforts from every character to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leave one out and you risk leaving a large gap in the logic of your story . Cover them all " as Sicario does " and you only risk them demanding a second viewing . <p> Main Character Kate ( Emily Blunt ) shows us what it is like to deal with these dangerous activities on a personal level . We are there with her during the first raid and right by her side during the expedition in the tunnel . While there are dangerous activities going on around her , it is only through her eyes that we get to feel what is like to experience conflict within the context of physical activities ( Main Character Throughline Domain of Activity ) . <p> We feel what it is like to fight this battle on the ground ( Doing ) , we feel what it is like to kill the enemy ( Obtaining ) , we feel what it is like to misunderstand the intentions of our coworkers ( Understanding ) , and we feel the conflict involved in finding out exactly what is going on ( Learning ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concern ( Main Character Concern of Learning ) : learning about Juarez , learning about those hidden tunnels across the border , learning how to deal with local authorities when crossing the border .

Strategy covers her personal distaste for the plan-of-attack presented to her . Analysis is seen in her threats of reporting what she sees . And finally , the greatest Issue of all for Kate are those Preconditions ( Main Character Issue of Preconditions ) . All of these variations of narrative create conflict for her ; it is the last that is the true source of her troubles . <p> Kate is being used as a Precondition for all of this illegal activity to occur . Without her , the CIA could not conduct its operation ; they need local law enforcement along for the ride in order to operate within the U.S. border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major issue for her personally . <h> Influence Character Throughline <p> Alejandro Gillick ( Benicio del Toro ) represents the alternative perspective that challenges Kates way of resolving problems . Experiencing him on a first-person intimate level , we the audience get to see the impact such an approach has through the context of manipulations ( Influence Character Domain of Manipulation ) . <p> Alejandros sole purpose is to intimidate and coerce everyone around him , not simply Kate . The water-boarding . The murders . Whereas the physical conflict Kate experiences truly are the source of trouble in her Throughline , the " message " Alejandro is trying to communicate to the Mexican drug cartels is more a call to change ones way of thinking and to get the idea that the big boys are back in town ( Influence Character Concern of Conceiving an Idea ) . <p> When the Colombians fell out of power , they left behind a significant hole in the trafficking of illegal trugs . This deficit led to a violent power struggle that threatens the stability of everyones operations ( U.S. included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his focus on that deficiency of leadership drives Kate and many other to reconsider their position on the situation ( Influence Character Issue of Deficiency ) .

Remember that the Overall Story is a perspective taking a look at everyone in the story and the problems they face .

Still others do what they can to keep their children fed and a roof over their heads ( Work " corrupt officer Silvio ) . Yet it is the Attempt to do something outside of regulations that receives the most attention here . Waiting to call " weapons free " until the R.O.E . can be obscured by place and time is a blatant example of engaging in a problematic Attempt ( *Overall Story Issue of Attempt* ) . <h> Relationship Story Throughline <p> Many stories stop with those three.1 Lucky for us , Sicario completed the argument by giving us that final perspective of what it is like when we have a problem . <p> Securing the Overall Story Issue in Attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very beginning , Kate doubts Alejandro and his story , where he is from and what he is capable of doing . That doubt puts a wall between them and keeps them from working efficiently together . Their relationship " this gathering of the " good guys " and " the enemy of my enemy " is seen within the context of Fixed Attitudes ( Relationship Story Throughline of Fixed Attitudes ) " Kate sees it one way , Alejandro sees it another . Counter this issue of skepticism between them with a drive between both to investigate what the other is up to and you have the foundation for a meaningful relationship to counter-balance the more logisitical problems occurring in the Overall Story ( Relationship Story Counterpoint of Investigation ) . The lack of contemplation on either side fuels the heart of the story and hints at the Authors true reason for writing this piece ( Relationship Story Concern of Contemplation ) . <h> Multi-Appreciation Moments <p> Beyond supplying the audience with all four Throughlines , Sicario is masterful in its ability to craft Multi-Appreciation Moments .

That I should somehow become a vessel for the mighty Universe to create throughwhat singular ego would turn down such a magnificent opportunity ? <p> Precisely . <p> I 'd run rampant . Toss in several more egos , perhaps a whole writing " team " , and this highly touted process descends into a tangled morass of competing ideas with no real meaningful connection . Sure , occasionally this approach results in a gem . But for the most part constant guessing , missed opportunities and endless rabbit holes become the cornerstones of " letting yourself go . " <p> There has to be a better way . <h> The Problem With Collaboration <p> Suggesting a plot point or character moment because you once had the same experience in 4th grade rarely improves a work of fiction . Collaborating with others who also insist on injecting their rose-colored elementary school life into a work in progress only compounds the error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphs over the trust-the-process crowd because there is one mind writing one story .

Could one even tell if the idea was trash before mixing its way into the process ? <p> A story is an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem . Unless the team agrees ahead of time to adopt the same mindset , the end result will always be a mish-mash of incompatible psychologies . In short , the story will be schizophrenic . <p> Or even shorterthe story will suck . <p> This is why the films based on a singular vision ( one writer/director ) often turn out to be the most solid .

While hundreds upon thousands of problems exist , a truly holistic story only stops to consider one . <p> This singular problem can not be described in words nor can it be expressed with a simple sentence . If that were possible , it would negate the need for story . Instead , aspects of character , plot , theme and genre work together in concert to approximate the problem ( really the inequity ) at the heart of a story .

To mix and match would prove disastrous . <h> I 've Got an Idea ! <p> Toy Story 2 focuses on developing an appreciation for toys . Everyone in the story finds themselves concerned with this issue . Their focus lies in developing that understanding . The rest of the film matches that initial concern , thus insuring a complete and fulfilling story . Woodys concerns himself with issues of what once was . Jesse shares a similar concern , yet focuses more on the memories of what was lost . And together the two try to figure out where they best fit in . <p> Four major throughlines , four major areas of concern , all focused in the same thematic area . <p> Now what if instead , Jesse concerned herself with her love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old West ?

Yet this is exactly the sort of incompatible thematic material brainstormed in story meetings time and time again . <p> The writer who might have suggested it can probably relate to such an instance , perhaps theyve always loved Westerns and cowboy culture and cant wait to infuse their personal take on the genre into this film . But would the audience appreciate this new perspective ? For that matter , would the story mind itself be able to appreciate it ? <p> No . And that is why it is paramount that these areas of concern be solidified early on in the development process . <h> Starting with the End in Mind <p> More often than not , a project falters because of this misplaced trust in the Universe . Meaningless character moments and stilted sequences wedge themselves into a piece that simply has no place for them . <p> Trusting the process places trust in the human mind to keep perspectives consistent .

A catastrophe set to doom the crews following up to many hours of wasted overtime . <p> Of course a writer needs to be allowed their moments of creative exploration . Those chance moments of divine inspiration ? That 's why many set out to write in the first place . <p> But if the end result remains producing something truly meaningful and ultimately powerful to an Audience , nailing down the singular mind of a story becomes job one .

If story concerns itself with solving problems , then it only follows that a better understanding of how the human mind solves problems will lead to a better and more meaningful storytelling . <p> Breaking the area of concern breaks the mind of a story . Broken minds reveal themselves in fits of insanity . If you want an answer as to why many films as of late simply do n't  have great stories , this is why . Deluding oneself into believing that benevolent artistic forces guide writers down the path of success only robs Audiences of something truly moving .

The other three fall into place in that Lower Left box . A deviation from this results in stories that are confused and a waste of what little money anyone has anymore . <p> If the Overall Story Concern is Understanding ( as it was in the above example of Toy Story 2 ) , then the other three Throughlines will focus their area of Concern of The Past , Memories , and Conceptualizing .

They feel drawn to themes and issues that resonate with their own personal issues and use storytelling to work through those problems . Director Christopher Nolan is no different . <p> Appraising Nolans catalog of films through the eyes of Dramatica reveals a common set of elements .

In Memento , Leonard ( Guy Pearce ) struggles to fight against his disability with short-term memory . Inception explores the conflict involved in getting Robert ( Cillian Murphy ) to understand a key bit of information .

But it was n't . <p> For years , I have searched for the correct storyform for this film . For those unfamiliar with the Dramatica theory of story , a storyform is a collection of seventy-five story points that maintain the message of a narrative . Dramaticas story points are not independent , but rather interdependent . They work together to provide a holistic hologram of Authors Intent and help identify why a story unfolds the way it does . <p> While looking for the storyform for Batman Begins , I knew that elements of Equity and Inequity would somehow be involved . Justice and restoring balance play a heavy hand in this film . And I felt certain that Issues of Interdiction would come into playonce you see someone or something headed down a dark path you often want to intercede on their behalf and fix it . But I was n't sure where the actual Throughlines fell within the Dramatica Table of Story Elements . <h> Throughlines and Areas of Conflict <p> Dramatica was the first theory of story to identify four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> These are not separate storylines . The Main Character exists within the Overall Story . So does the Influence Character . But their subjective points-of-view rest within their individual Throughlines . This is key because these Throughlines are actually points-of-views on conflict themselves : <p> OS Throughline is THEY <p> MC Throughline is I <p> IC Throughline is YOU <p> RS Throughline is WE <p> In addition to seeing Throughlines as these distinct points-of-view , Dramatica identifies four areas where conflict is found : <p> a fixed , external problem or Situation <p> a shifting , external problem or Activity <p> a fixed , internal problem or Fixed Attitude <p> a shifting , internal problem or Way of Thinking <p> Four points-of-view . Four ways of seeing conflict . Attach each of the Throughlines to one of these areas of conflict and you have a complete story . Only one rule : the Overall Story Throughline and Relationship Story Throughline must be diagonally across from each other , and so must the Main Character Throughline and the Influence Character Throughline . <p> So if you have an Overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throughline will be in a Way of Thinking , or Manipulation . Think of Star Wars or Casablanca . In those films , everyone is dealing with physical conflict that needs to be stopped , while intimately a relationship explores conflict born out of manipulation . <p> This works for the Main Character and Influence Character dynamic as well . If you put the Main Character Throughline in Situation , that means the Influence Character Throughline will be in Fixed Attitude . Think Inside Out or Rain Man . In those films , the central character deals intimately with problems arising from status , while they face another character stuck with a certain fixation in his or her mind . <p> When I first saw Batman Begins in 2006 , I felt for certain the Overall Story Throughline would fall under Situation . After all , there was a lot of discussion over Gotham and how it compared to civilizations in the past , and how it needed to be thrown into darkness in order for the light to rise again . Everyone found themselves dealing with that conflict . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall into either an Activity or a Way of Thinking . Way of Thinking felt totally wrong : Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins is nothing like Hamlet or Salieri In Amadeus .

That 's not how a Throughline works . <p> After ten years of struggling with identifying this film , it was time to cheat . <h> A Hidden Clue to the Structure <p> In Dramatica there is a story point known as the Main Character Approach that classifies the central character of a story into two different camps : a Do-er or a Be-er . Classifying the Main Character as one or the other defines whether the Main Character prefers to solve their personal problems externally or internally . <p> It also defines where the Throughline will fall . <p> If the Main Character prefers to solve problems externally , then their Throughline will be either in a Situation or an Activity . Once we identify where we think a problem is , we see a solution there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with , then we will first try to solve it externallythus , Do-er . <p> If we have an internal problem we are dealing with , then we will first try to solve it internally either through a Fixed Attitude or Way of Thinking . This is why a Be-er prefers to solve their problems internally . <p> Note that this is only a preference . Clearly Main Characters can do both . What the Main Character Growth is trying to communicate is which one the Main Character prefers to do first . Some like to change the world around him , while other prefer to change themselves first . <p> Bruce Wayne is the latter . <p> At first , this may seem counterintuitive . Certainly Bruce spends the bulk of the film doing things . When we first meet him he takes on seven prisoners by himself , for " practice " . He engages in ninja school and spends pretty much the entire second half of the film fighting his way to victory . <p> But when you look at the personal moments with Wayne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character onlyyou can begin to see a preference for a different kind of approach . <h> Personal Issues Unique to the Main Character <p> When looking to identify the Main Character Throughline of a story , it is important to look for those things that are unique to the Main Character and no one else . The stuff of this Throughline is the kind of stuff the Main Character would take with them into any storynot just the one in front of us . Look for their emotional baggage , those issues they are trying to overcome . <p> Waynes greatest personal issue that is unique to him surrounds the murder of his parents and this idea that his fears were somehow responsible for their death . This is n't a Situation . Or an Activity . Or even a Way of Thinking . This is a Fixed Attitude . <p> And it should n't be surprising because Christopher Nolan likes Main Characters who struggle with what they thinkMain Characters who struggle with their Fixed Attitudes . Leonard in Momento . Robert Angiers ( Hugh Jackman ) in The Prestige . Obsession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storiesincluding Batman Begins . <h> When Throughlines Fall into Place <p> Identifying Bruce Wayne as a Be-er dealing with a Fixed Attitude ends up forcing his Influence Character into Situation . The question is , who is Bruce Waynes Influence Character ? What relationships represents the heart of the story ? <p> His relationship with Rachel Dawes ( Katie Holmes ) seems to be the likely candidate . But remember , the Influence Character is a point-of-view not a character . Rachel does n't  really challenge Bruce on his approach to things . And when she does , she is really just standing in for another character . So who stirs up all kinds of trouble because of a point-of-view they have in regards to a certain Situation ? <p> Ras al Ghul . <p> That perspective that Gotham should perish and go the way of Rome or Constantinople is n't the source of conflict everyone experiences . Rather , it is the point of view of the League of Shadows as expressed through Ras al Ghul/Ducard ( Liam Neeson ) . <p> This idea that Bruce should embrace his fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , the drive to do great and terrible things " comes from Ducard . And it is exactly what Bruce needs to hear in order to grow through his own Fixed Attitude . Ducard connects with Bruce because it is a similar , yet slightly different perspective . Similar in that it is fixed , different in that it is external whereas Bruces perspective is internal . <p> This is why they can have their " You and I " moment after training . They are both alike in that they are both seeing conflict from a fixed point-of-view , but they are different in that one is external and the other internal . This dissonance fuels their interactions . That argument over the will to act is the text of Relationship Story Throughline . <h> Finding the Storyform for a Story <p> The quad of four elements below represents Ras al Ghuls point-of-view as seen through the eyes of Dramatica . Ras is driven by peoples fears , angers , and their refusal to accept the drive deep within them to do terrible things . And this drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or peace as the problem in the world . And in response , he upsets the balance of things : " When a forest grows too wild , a purging fire is inevitable and natural . " <p> From there , Dramatica begins to work its magic and predicts story elements not selected . For Ras Issue of Interdiction to work , Bruce himself must be facing an Issue of Suspicion . The suspicion that he had something to do with the murder of his family , and the suspicion that he is somewhat like his fatherwho also failed to act . <p> For Ras Concern of the Past to work ( which is forced by our selection of the Issue of Interdiction ) then Bruces Concern must have something to do with Memories . Anytime he steps out of his role as billionaire vigilante and confronts his own demons , they always have something to do with suppressed Memories . <p> The magic of Dramatica is simply balance . If an Influence Character looks to the Past , then a Main Character must look to their Memories . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Character must look to their own Suspicions . Whether Christopher Nolan or screenwriter David S. Goyer looked to Dramatica for help or not , that natural balance within the story is there . <p> Perhaps they found it as a result of writing stories with similar thematic intent . Maybe the first came out a little rough , but as they continued to explore this area and refine their understandings of it , their intuition kicked in and assured a proper balance between the Throughlines . Dramatica is built on the psychology of the mind , not on observable repeated patterns within film . It only makes sense then that a theory based on the psychology of the human mind would be able to predict the intuition of a writer trying to construct a well-balanced story . <h> Something More Than Backstory <p> The confusion involved in locating the storyform for Batman Begins can be attributed to the use of time-shifting in the StoryWeaving phase . What looks like backstory is really an essential part of Bruce Waynes growth as a Main Character . In next weeks article we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain how the mechanism of its narrative works .

The film will be available on Netflix in February . <p> Macon Blairs directorial debut I Do n't  Feel at Home in This World Anymore opened the 2017 Sundance Film Festival , yet failed to set the bar for effective and meaningful narrative . While most deficient films tend to overlook the Influence Character or Relationship Story Throughlines , IDFAHITWA achieved the hard-to-accomplish task of screwing up the Overall Story Throughline . Its thereit just does n't  stay true to itself , fracturing the narrative and ending up a pointless and absurd experience.1 <p> Ruth ( Melanie Lynsky ) is the SituationMain Character . A caretaker faced daily with the meaninglessness of life , Ruth struggles to come to terms with how cruel and thoughtless humanity is to itself . When she returns home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force who could n't care less , Ruth sets out to take care of business herself . <p> Ruths Goal as Protagonist starts out something along the lines of forcing people to stop being assholes ( a Changing Ones Nature Goal ) but then eventually devolves into something more along the lines of staying alive amidst violent people ( an Obtaining Goal ) . As a consequence , the film leaves the Audience wondering the point of the whole thing . <p> Stories in the Psychology Domain require the Author to focus on conflict emanating from how characters think , not on the violence they rain down on each other . Authors unfamiliar with defining the source of conflict in their stories often make this mistake . <p> IDFAHITWA starts in the Psychology Domain , then shifts into the Activity Domaina jarring and confusing experience for any audience . <h> As Opposed to Good ? <p> Its no coincidence that Quentin Tarantinos film Reservoir Dogsfor which Macon clearly draws fromcelebrated its 25th anniversary at Sundance this year . <p> Tarantinos directorial debut starts and ends masterfully in the Activity Domain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere else . Quentin lays out the conflict at hand and stays true to it . <h> Without Resolve Only Shock <p> Elijah Woods Tony is awkward and hilarious and a perfect companion to Ruth , yet neither he nor Ruth experience that paradigm shifting change of Resolve that every great story needs to function properly . Ruth starts out a Do-er and ends up as one ; Tony starts out a Be-er and ends up there as well . The film never clues us in on which approach works best and how that better approach went about working to resolve the situation at hand . Without that key component we can only laugh as the events unfold and be shocked at the dark violence . <p> I Do n't  Feel brings plenty of shock . It may start out Indie-innocent enough , but as with the Domainsthe storys Genres shift so abruptly from Entertainment to Drama that they rip you out of the experience . <h> The Four Modes of Expression <p> A quad of expression , or Genres , exist for all conflict within a story : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift from one Genre to the next in a single work , but only by stepping to the Genre adjacent to the one you are leaving . Skipping feels inherently unnatural to the human mind . <p> You can move from Entertainment to Comedy and then to Drama and then back to Comedy . But you ca n't skip over one to get to the other . To do so would invite confusion and require the Audience to fill in the blanks . This finds evidence in forced laughter during serious or over-the-top sequences . Audiences cant help itthey need to in order to keep their mental balance intact . <p> I Do n't  Feel at Home in This World Anymore is worth seeingreally funnybut only worth seeing once . I cant tell you how many times Ive seen Reservoir Dogs or how many times I 'll see it again .

Twenty-five years later people continue to line up in the freezing cold temperatures because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strives to achieve the same but loses grasp the moment it drops focus and resorts to absurd shock value .

@@119272724 @8272724/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> All You Ever Needed to Know About Dramatica <h> Dramatica differentiates itself by making the optional essential . <p> Unlearning what you have learned can be a difficult process , especially if you have achieved a relative amount of success . Why fix what is n't broken ? Giving up and proceeding blindly because that is where one finds comfort marks the difference between a serviceable story and an enduring one . <p> When I ask my students what story is many answer with something about character or plot . Some might add that it is important for stories to have a theme . Others speak of their favorite genre or about genres in particular . Regardless of what aspect they identify , most understand what goes in to making a story . <p> The Dramatica theory of story says that character , plot , theme and genre are not enough ; that this basic understanding of story is just that : basic . And if you really want to comprehend the complexity that is successful narrative you need to dig deeper , and look wider . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general understanding of story sees narrative as a single thread of character , plot , theme and genre . Dramatica sees not just one , but four threadseach with its own perspective on things and each with its own character , plot , theme and genre . The competent writer weaves these four threads into one giant thread that then becomes a fully functioning story . <p> Simple , right ? <p> Conceptually this is the hardest thing for writers new to the theory to understand ; it also happens to be the most important . Everything that comes after in Dramatica is merely a refinement of that central understanding . Absorb this concept and your writing will take on a new depth . <p> Many of us were taught that multiple threads in a story are optional ways for us to add complexity to a story . Optional means they can be there or not at the authors discretion . The Dramatica approach removes that option and instead turns them into a requirement necessary to create a full and complete story . That is a huge difference between traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Understanding <p> Not only does Dramatica present this wildly bizarre take on storyit also defines the specific areas where character , plot , theme and genre can be explored and presents limitations for each . No other paradigm defines the nature of the content and then offers an in-depth presentation of the elemental nature of that content . <p> Complexity arises as we enter uncharted terrain . <p> From the Audiences perspective , it is virtually impossible to tell what is an essential component of story and what can be broken down further . For instance , many see character arc as a singular concept : how the character changes . Dramatica dives deeper and breaks down characters arc into its base elements : Resolve and Growth . <p> Depending on the perspective taken , elements of story can be seen as a state or a process . Looking at light we can see that it can be seen as a particle or a waveforma state or a process , respectively . The same occurs with a story point like character arc . <p> The Resolve represents the static element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed or remained steadfast . The Growth showcases the process inherent in a characters arc : how the characters resolve changes over time . <h> The Benefits of Breaking Down Story <p> Understanding the base elements of a concept like character arc allows writers the opportunity to focus on the essential ingredients of their story . They can focus and work on those story points independently , develop them exclusive of outside interference and then blend them back together . Its easier to understand a characters arc when you can evaluate it in terms of Resolve and Growth . Other paradigms simply call for change ; Dramatica defines the change and how that change develops . <p> As you can see , Dramatica can get very complicated very quickly . Concepts of storytelling that for the longest time were never separated now find themselves apart and naked , exposed for the benefit of writers everywhere . Main Character and Protagonist . Resolve and Growth . These refinements of story structure enrich narrative and bring depth to the superficial . <p> It all boils down to that first idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The concept of the four throughlines is the single most important and difficult aspect of Dramatica because it tells us that stories are not single threads of characters , plots , themes and genre elements woven together into complex patterns that we see in finished works .

Plot tell us how to work with character . Theme discusses what is important to us and how to think about those characters . Genre tells us how we want to feel by going through this experience of this story ; when we walk out , what are we supposed to be feeling ? 1 <p> These four things wrap themselves around the subject matter of the story .

@@119272728 @8272728/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> The Story Structure of True Detective <h> Form does not determine structure ; the same psychological process that fuels film also runs through the bloodstream of television . <p> Format does not determine structure . Whether screenplay , novel , or play , a complete story calls for the same basic ingredients . Television series work the samethey simply take longer to simmer . <p> The number one question asked of Dramatica is " Does it work for television ? " 1 Many see the value of it in context of a screenplay or feature film , but wonder if the " structure " of Dramatica can be applied to a longer series . <p> First , there is no " structure " to Dramatica . Unlike other paradigms or interpretations of story that collect a sequence of beats or steps along a Heros Journey , the Dramatica theory of story applies a model of psychology to narrative . It doeesnt see psychology in narrative . That 's an important distinction . <p> If the Author of a television series intends to say something with their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then yes , the model of Dramatica will work for them . The HBO television series True Detective had something important to say , some point-of-view it wished to argue . This purpose lends itself perfectly to a Dramatica interpretation , allowing greater insight into how one would structure a similar series . <h> Establishing a Way In <p> Before determining the storyform of True Detective , one must first determine the Main Character.2Audiences experience a story through the eyes of a Main Character . We empathize with them and we become intimately involved with their personal problems . In most storiesthose that last less than two hoursthe determination of this viewpoint is simple . True Detective took eight hours to tell , complicating this process with two very strong characterizations and an uncommon aspect of story structure . <p> Many would look to Rustin Cohle ( Matthew McConaughey ) and assume that he is the Main Character . While there were moments of insight into what it must be like to have drug-induced visions , rarely did we dive into what it feels like to be him . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . <p> Contrast this with the subjective point-of-view presented to us by Martin Hart ( Woody Harrelson ) . We become closely involved with his family and the fallout he creates when he gives in to temptation . We experience his loss with him , the same way all Audiences do with a Main Character . Rust , on the other hand , influences and challenges usmaking him a prime candidate for Influence Character . <h> Driving the Story Forward <p> Rust does , however , drive the story towards resolution . In both investigations , past and present , Rust pursues the killer without hesitation . This makes him the Protagonist of the story , not the Main Character.3 Many times the character through which the Audience experiences the story also takes responsibility for driving the story forward . This does n't  always have to be the case and True Detective shines as an example of the sophistication that occurs from splitting these functions . <p> With the establishment of Main Character and Influence Character , attention shifts to their individual points-of-view and more importantly their final resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps solidify the storyform . <h> Two Different Approaches <p> The passionate argument between Marty and Rust revolves around the presence of an afterlife . This argument extends into disagreements over the existence of God and the relative objective value of religion in the human experience . During the revival scene of Episode 3 , the two argue over the " common good " with Marty taking the side of those praying before them . <p> Rust responds with his version of the truth : <p> If the only thing keeping a person decent is the expectation of divine reward then , brother , that person is a piece of shit . And I 'd like to get as many of them out in the open as possible . <p> Rust is a nihilist . Pessimistic and skeptical of the true nature of man , the man who lost his daughter sees any concept of the afterlife as a " fairy tale " . His entire worldview revolves around this dark interpretation of human existence and he maintains that perspective throughout . <p> Marty , for all his infidelities and shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood the importance of spirituality because of his infidelities . He saw the value of a higher power and its ability to keep those given to " debauchery and murder " in line . If a member of law enforcement cant control himself , who can ? <p> Marty spares no opportunity to argue with Rust about this need for the light and carries that perspective through the final scene . This defines him as having a Steadfast Resolve . <h> Steadfast . Not Static . <p> Having a Steadfast Resolve does not mean a character does not waver . Marty had his resolve torn down throughout the series ( mostly due to his own actions ) , but in the end held fast . He never changed and adopted Rusts negative view of the world . He did n't  give up his religion nor dwelled on how dark the world was , but he did give up at times . When asked what made him quit being a detective , Marty recounts : <p> Fantastic example of a Steadfast character wavering in their resolve . If Marty had continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect less of those around him , then yes , he would have been the character with the Changed Resolve . But he did n't  stay that way . <p> It was only once Rust showed him the tape of the young girl being raped that Marty reaffirmed his stance and declared his steadfast resolve . This is what great Influence Characters do in a story : they challenge the Main Characters Resolve and force them to grow into or out of it . Marty was ready to give up , claim Rust " insane " and live out his life alone and negative . Rusts challenge brought Marty out of his funk and reaffirmed his belief that this was a world worth fighting for . <p> To some , this seems like Marty has changed , but really he has n't  . He has grown , but he has n't  changed his original worldview . That signficant change belongs to Rust . <h> Nihilist to Optimist <p> Every conversation in the car , every quip or negative put-down thrown to Marty , every last line of dialogue from Rust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been proven . Through the course of the series we learn that this particular negative justification came about as a way of him dealing with the death of his daughter . Backstories are where the change character develops their justifications for doing the things they do , and Rust has a very good reason why he thinks the way he does . <p> But that Resolve changes . Once he sees for himself what lies beyond the veil , once he sees and feels for himself his daughter and his family , beckoning him forth , does he finally change the way he sees things : <p> This is a completely different Rust from the one we saw in Season 3 . These are not the words of a nihilist . <p> There was a moment , I know , when I was under in the darkI could feel my definitions fading . And beneath that darkness there was another kindit was deeperwarm , like a substance . I could feel man , I knew , I knew my daughter waited for me , thereI could feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was part of everything that I have ever loved , and we were all , the three of us , just fading outand then I woke up . <p> In fact , Rust even has to remind Marty of how things are : <p> You 're looking at it wrong , the sky thingonce there was only dark . You ask me , the lights winning . <p> These final words cement Rust as having a Changed Resolve . <h> Purpose and Meaning <p> In every complete story , two opposing approaches to life come into conflict . Back and forth they give and they take until finally , one approach gives in to the other . One character adopts the other characters point-of-view.True Detective adopted this process but spaced it out over the course of an entire series . Whereas some episodes of a series act as self-contained stories4 , the entire first season of True Detective portrayed one single story . Beginning with Rusts nihilistic and somewhat accurate perspective and ending with this glimmering hope of light beating dark , the Authors of True Detective crafted an argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love this series and were so into it , besides the excellent acting , opening titles , and stark reality of Louisianna , was this idea that there was something more to all of it then those surface-level items . <p> Why Unproven ? Rusts arc from Unproven to Proven works well : its only once he sees for himself what lies beyond that he can finally Change his Resolve . In the Overall Story , the Fact that Reginald Ledouxs guilt was never proven created a series of problems . Add to this the idea that Rust focuses on the lies people tell themselves ( Non-Accurate ) and responds by calling people out for " a propensity for obesity " a failure to " split the atom " ( Accurate ) and one gets the sense that this is the correct storyform . <p> Taking a step back , Marty and Rust argue over each others Fixed Attitude and the Value of a religious or spiritual life . Martys Activities cause him personal grief , with Rusts Psychological " bullshit " and " ten-dollar words " influencing him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials and a serial killer on the loose threatens to make matters worse ( Progress ) . <p> Whether or not the Authors of True Detective consulted Dramatica to help write their masterwork , one can see the various story points that work together to help formulate an argument . To emulate the success of this HBO series , one must determine what it is they want to say ( or argue ) , discover the appropriate storyform , and consult it when planning out the series . <p> Of course , it helps if they 're a talented writer as well . : ) <p> Well , the real number one question concerning Dramatica is always " Why is it SO #@$% ! complicated ? ! " , but the television one is a close second . ? ? <p> A storyform combines seventy-five thematic elements together and provides the message of the story . ? ? <p> The so-called " monster " episodes of The X-Files work as self-contained stories . Clyde Bruckmans Final Repose and Beyond the Sea are two examples where a single storyform played out over one episode . ? ?

Four Acts in every Throughline . Four Sequences in every Act . Four Scenes in every Sequence . And four Events in every Scene . <p> Again , this is perfect story structure math . Reality rarely plays out the same way . <p> This article showcases our first foray into Scene Structure . In the following sections we will define the various appreciations found at this level . In future articles , we will expand on the concept and provide examples of this structure in action . <h> The Four Modalities of Scene Structure <p> In that same article , Melanie lists four different modalities of Scene Structure in Dramatica . The first three assign " markers " to each of the Events within a Scene : <p> each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , a P , R , C , O , for context , and be a Situation ( Universe ) , Attitude ( Mind ) , Activity ( Physics ) , and Mentality ( Psychology ) .

A little more on that later . <h> SRCA is NOT Storyweaving <p> While often presented as the order of events as revealed within the narrative , SRCA ( or 1234 ) is the order of events within the storyform. 9 times out of 10 this translates to SRCA in the real world : a scene will begin with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally the Aftermath . <p> Some Authors choose to jumble up their way through this order . Films like Memento and Pulp Fiction use time-shifting Storyweaving techniques to obscure the storyform . They may start with the Conflict , then show the Setup , then back to Conflict , and then maybe the Revelation , and finally the Aftermath . As long as the Audience can appreciate the actual order of events at the end of a story , the Author is free to mix and match the sequence any way he or she chooses . <p> once a story has been told , it is no longer appreciated simply as a progression . Rather , a story is similar to a television , scanning its electron gun across the screen . Slowly , through linear progression an image is built up . By the time the entire frame has been scanned a picture has been created that is greater than the sum of its parts . Similarly , the progression of a story , though linear in nature , ultimately constructs a greater meaning that is appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they reveal the events of a storyform to an Audience and the story will still carry the same meaning . <p> Where does one find this progression of events within Dramatica ? <h> Avoiding Writing by Numbers <p> Once an Author answers the eight Dynamic Questions or Essential Ingredients of story , the Dramatica engine winds up the model of the storyform creating the potential for a meaningful narrative . As it does this , the engine predicts the order ( SRCA ) and nature ( PRCO ) of every element in every quad at every level to achieve the impact set in the Dynamics . <p> Chris and Melanie purposefully left out the 1234 and PRCO of the dramatic circuits : <p> the data is so extensive that it takes several hundred pages to print it all outWe determined that this flood of information would drown authors in a sea of numbers , far away from the intuitive sense of writing . And , what 's more , it is SO specific that we thought it might lead to " writing by the numbers . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with that degree of detail so much , and really tends to " give " that to the author , even if it is out of order , as long as all the pieces are there somewhere . So , why worry about being that accurate when it has so little importance in the grand scheme of things ? <p> They vanquished the monster of perfect story structure before it saw the light of day . A glimpse of the SRCA progression lies within the progression of Signposts found within each Throughline " but that 's it . Until the day we meet that monster , Authors can simply set the SRCA and PRCO of their Scenes to the best of their abilties and with the purpose of providing meaning to their Audience . <h> Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome <p> Dramatica approaches story from the Authors point-of-view . The storyform is a holographic representation of Authors Intent . When appreciating the Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome of a dramatic unit in Dramatica the " message " the Author intends on communicating is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the circuit as the source of inequity for that dramatic movement as far as the Author is concerned . Instead of simply looking at the point where the Scene begins , the Author identifies where they believe the source of conflict for that scene eminates . If removed , the scene would lose purpose . All Events carry purpose " its a matter of where the dramatic emphasis is placed that determines PRCO . <p> The Resistance of a dramatic circuit amplifies or dimishes that Potential . In short , what does the Author believe makes things worse within the context of this dramatic unit ? How do they see the vibration of the initial inequity intensifying or dissipating ? <p> The Current of a dramatic circuit shows the play , or interaction , between Potential and Resistance . How does the Author see the escalation or de-escalation of conflict within this unit ? <p> And finally , the Outcome of a dramatic circuit shows where the Author sees Power eminating from this unit . This results in a positive or negative charge that leads to a possible potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spatial relationship between elements within a dramatic unit . If you look at a physical circuit board , different components account for the Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome of each circuit . The context of their function within the unit defines their relationship to one another . <h> Thought , Knowledge , Ability , and Desire <p> If SRCA represents the temporal progression of a dramatic unit , and PRCO represents the spatial relationship between the components , then TKAD defines the knowledge base " or area of conflict " within each event . <p> In Dramatica , every quad is really another way of looking at Thought , Knowledge , Ability , and Desire ( TKAD ) . Dramatica is a model of the storymind " an internal representation of our external universe : <p> Thought is the Energy of the mind <p> Knowledge is the Mass of the mind <p> Ability is the Space of the mind <p> Desire is the Time of the mind <p> These four bases find themselves at the Class level within the Dramatica Table of Story Elements : <p> Fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowledge/Mass <p> Activity classifies problems of Ability/Space <p> Manners of Thinking classify problems of Desire/Time <p> This is the point at which the model spirals back onto itself . When classifying the Events at the Scene levelat the point where the Dramatica model loops back onto itselfAuthors look to the Classes of Fixed Attitudes , Situations , Activities , and Manners of Thinking ( or Mentalities ) . In this way , the very smallest accounts for the very largest . <h> The Fourth Modality <p> Dramatica theory is quad theory . If you can find three of something , you can usually identify a fourthit just takes a little time to wrap your head around it . <p> Melanie describes the difference between a Structural Scene and a Storytelling Scene : <p> Structural Scenes illustrate these four Events in terms of Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre . <p> If the Author wishes to communicate structure , he or she assigns Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre " one of each " to the Events within a scene . By doing so , the Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate these four Events in terms of audience impact ( impacting the audience 's sense of their own Situation , affecting their Attitude , involving them in a vicarious Activity , or exploring the way their minds run by illuminating the Mentality ) . <p> These are the fun scenes . The ones that have very little to do with structure or the storyform itself . They thrill , chill , or perhaps tickle as they convey an experience to the Audience . Remove them and the meaning of the story would remain the same " it just would n't be as much fun . <p> Both Structural and Storytelling Scenes can be presented in Active or Passive fashion . Passive Scenes illustrate these Events in the Story or Audience . Active Scenes put them into motion , moving the story forward or invoking changes in the nature of the audience itself . <p> With this final explanation , Melanie completes the quad of modalities by presenting PASS : <p> Passive Storytelling Scenes illustrate the Events by impacting the Audiences sense of Situation , Attitude , Activity , and way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move the story forward through Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre <p> Active Storytelling Scenes use the four Events to invoke changes in the nature of the Audiences Situation , Attitude , Activity and Way of Thinking <p> PASS ( Passive , Active , Structural , Storytelling ) is not an Audience Appreciation " it is the Author 's determination of how they want to illustrate the scene . Their purpose in presenting the scene to an Audience . <p> If TKAD represents the knowledge base of the storyform and delivers the Understanding to the Audience , then PASS teaches that storyform to the Audience " the Learning to the storyforms Understanding . In effect , the Author PASSes on the information contained in the storyform through this final modality . <h> Intention and Meaning <p> With the fourth and final modality defined , Authors can now develop their scenes by identifying the area of conflict in each event , the order in which they appear , their relationship to each other in terms of the dramatic circuit , and a means by which they intend to illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the modalities still exists within a shroud of mystery beneath Dramaticas story enginea means by which to construct solid scenes around meaningful and purposeful events now exists . <p> Rather than decry the trappings of perfect story structure , perhaps the conversation should veer more towards the ability Dramatica provides writers to construct powerful scenes that effectively communicate their deepest intentions .

@@119272746 @8272746/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> The Delectable and Exquisite Themes of Ratatouille <p> When it comes to the theme of a story , most fall back on the Controlling Idea principle , that is , the one overriding thematic concept that flows through an entire piece of narrative fiction . Saddled with this bit of knowledge , most first-time writers ponder incessantly over their one perfect idea , spending a year or two trying to force every scene under its repressive umbrella . <p> Their work becomes stifled , the author constricted by such a narrow appreciation of the measuring stick that is them . Any attempt by the writers instinct to perk its timid , yet always prescient , voice up over the cubicle walls of their mind is met with swift and violent action . The suggestion that there might be something more only results in a puff of red mist , another victim of the sniper rifle held by reductive paradigm gurus . <p> How comforting is it then to find out that there are actually four entirely different themes at work within a complete story . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not at all . The thing is , even though there are multiple themes , they are actually tied together in a very meaningful way . They are n't  as separate as one might think . <p> For instance , if you are exploring the issues that grow from people working for their own good ( as in Unforgiven ) , it only makes sense that you should also explore the dedication the two principal characters in the story have towards acheiving their goal and maybe even the dedication they have towards one another ( as is so expertly done with William Munny and Ned in the same film ) . One theme plays off of the other . <p> What about Neos issue of whether or not he is open to new things like bending spoons or stopping bullets in mid-air in The Matrix ? Does n't  it follow that Morpheus , the primary influence on Mr. Andersens character , should somehow be providing an alternative perspective by how diligently the bald man works to bring his search for the One to an end ? The impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The selfishness explored in Unforgiven is complemented by the dedication the two former killers have for each other . Neos openness is juxtaposed by Morpheus and his drive to bring things to an end . In both cases , the individual storylines are looking at the same problem ( and we all know that stories are really about solving problems , right ? ) , only they 're coming at them from two different perspectives . Placing them together in the same narrative work helps create a meaningful experience in the minds of the audience . <p> Brad Bird understood this when he set out to fix Ratatouille for Pixar back in the mid-aughts . <h> The Rat , The Boy , Their Friendship and The Restaurant <p> Before diving into an exploration of the thematic issues at work in this beautiful film , it becomes necessary to take a step back . As with all Pixar films , Ratatouille creates story magic by crafting a complete story comprising of four interconnected throughlines . <p> The first , and most recognizable throughline , is that of Remy . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of a rodent . As the only vermint who walks on two feet , Remy sets himself apart from the others , building a reputation for himself by simply being different from the rest of his kind . It causes problems for him and thus , by definition , becomes his own personal throughline . In other words , his is the Main Character Throughline . <p> The second throughline , perhaps not as obvious yet no less important , is that of Liguini . As the big-nosed nephew of famed chef Gusteau , Linguini arrives on scene ready to conquer the world . However , with no idenitfiable talent to speak of he is relegated to the position of garbage-boy . This quick assesment of his ability is a huge problem for him and calls to mind the same kind of issues that Remy himself faces , albeit from a less personal point-of-view . We never really step into Linguinis shoes and thus , he provides the Impact Character Throughline . <p> Both boy and rat develop a relationship , thus cementing the third throughline , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impact Character becomes the " heart " of every story , apparent in scenes similar to the one where Linguini let 's Remy go , only to have him quickly return . While both of these characters are very much alike , they still approach things from two different ways . Learning how to work together covertly , with Remy under hat , becomes the central concern of their developing friendship . <p> Lastly , there is the actual story of Ratatouille itself , the story of a rat who wants to prove once and for all that " Anyone Can Cook . " Here , one can find conflict with the current propreitor of Gusteaus , vertically-challenged Skinner , and eventually with the vampirical master critic , Anton Ego . Remy and Liguinis crafty ruse plays out within this Overall Story Throughline , the throughline that involves all the characters within a logistical argument where eventually one side wins and the other loses . <p> Four throughlines , four different perspectives on the same problem , one complete story . But what is most compelling about all of these is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drawn to Beauty <p> The thematic issues at play within Remys throughline is that of being drawn toward something . Personally , he is very intrigued , very inspired by the smells and the artistry that comes with the creation of a perfect meal . While he cant explain it , it is something that he is deeply attracted to , yet something he could never realistically have . It is the problem of many artists trapped in dire or repressive situations , and one any audience member can easily relate to . <h> First Impressions Are a Bitch <p> Juxtaposing this attraction towards beauty is the initial assesment that others have of Linguini . Just as Remy is drawn toward something , Linguini is prevented from moving forward in life because of the first impressions others have of him . People look at Liguini and they know right off the bat what he is good for . Remys felt the same , yet seeing it played out in another person has an effect on him and challenges the poor little rat to question whether or not his dreams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can two learn to work together when they come from completely different worlds ? One step at a time . One foot in front of the other . Whatever cliched phrase works to convey the importance of progressing forward is sufficient enough to explain the issues at work between them . Linguini often wants to jump right in whereas Remy would rather practice all night , taking it from the top if they have to . This is how two learn to work together when they do n't  even know if they can , or if they are even allowed to . <h> Anyone Can Cook <p> Easily the most recognizable theme of the film , the idea that permission is not something to be granted dictates the issues faced by everyone . Whereas the emotional argument carried out between the Remy and Linguini involves the steps they have to take to move forward , the bigger issue at work is whether or not anyone should be allowed to move forward at all . Gusteau put forth the idea that Anyone Can Cook , but really , can a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece , the one that drives the whole story forward and helps to frame the unexpected ending with greater meaning . <h> Writing With Four Themes <p> Did Brad Bird know all of this when he was creating this film ? Most likely not . Great filmmakers are rarely aware of the processes and underlying structure that infuses their work with great meaning . They just know it works . And Ratatouille really works . <p> The issue of whether or not anyone can cook is played out against the steps two characters must take in order to learn how to work well together , almost showing how each grants the other permission to step forward . The latter is a more emotional version of the former played out against the quiet landscape of two simple people . Likewise , you have the unfortunate first impressions of Linguini being explored within Remy as well . Everyone looks at a rat and knows instantly what they think of him . Remy , of course , rebukes such appraisals , knowing full well that he cant resist something he is drawn too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of who gives him permission . And in that way , the four themes circle back into one another . <p> Complete stories should seek to provide an audience with more than simply one controlling idea . There can , of course , be one idea that has more emphasis than the others but as can be seen with Ratatouille this more prominient idea is supported strongly by the other three . Issues do not happen in a vaccuum , they are meaningless when presented so . Progress can not be made without the other inequity pushing against it . The reason you have the other throughlines is to grant meaning to the others . Combine them all together and you have one sophisitcated machine for gifiting greater meaning to an audience . <p> Can there be anything more delicious ? 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> The thematic issues in Ratatouille are so expertly crafted that it almost seems like Dramatica had a hand in it .

Ryan cant step outside of himself and see how efforts to reduce the connections in your life can lead to problems . In fact , if you were to ask Ryan at the beginning of the story how he felt about things , hed say " Great ! " <p> Which leads us to another intriguing aspect of this story <h> Change Is Not Always Good <p> My wife , who is not half the StoryFanatic I am , had this to say as the end credits began to roll : <p> That is the only movie Ive seen where they setup this guy with an empty life , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more miserable . Before the story he was blissfully unaware ; he had found a way of life that worked for him . But now that he s aware that there is more to life , his happiness is all but gone . If he had never met Natalie , he would have been fine and would have continued to see Alex from time to time . <p> I could n't have said it better ! <p> This is precisely what Up In The Air was trying to communicate . Ryans transformational change of character , while at first glance the right thing to do , actually brought him to a place of even greater angst . Enlightenment does n't  always have to be a positive thing and there is nothing wrong with a story that takes this approach . In fact , some may say that a story like this is more honest as it more closely resembles what happens in real life . <p> The bittersweet feeling this film has at the end is due to the fact that it was structured as a Personal Tragedy . Ryan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his attempts to show what a bad idea firing people over the Internet is . <p> CRAIG GREGORY : ( business ) I need you back in the air . <p> Ryan does n't  react . <p> CRAIG GREGORY : Did you hear me ? I thought you 'd be thrilled . <p> RYAN : I 'm fine . What about video conferencing ? <p> CRAIG GREGORY : CTC is pausing on the whole new media front for a moment . Giving it a little more thought . Getting our work horses back out doing what they do best . <p> So the good guys win , but at what cost ? <p> Ryans journey failed to bring him any lasting comfort . This is best shown in the scene where he stands before the wall of airplane Departures . He now has a wealth of choices before him , all the potential in the world to make a connection , but he has no idea where to start . He has changed , but he has n't  been resolved . <p> The authors of this story were trying to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports their argument . <h> Shining a Light <p> One final thought concerning the heart of this story . Many would automatically assume that the relationship between Alex ( Vera Farmiga ) and Ryan represent the emotional core . After all , they do spend a lot of time in bed and Ryan eventually falls in love with her . <p> The problem with this is that Alex shares the same worldview that Ryan has . Exposing a character to someone who thinks just like them will do nothing for their development . It is only through alternative viewpoints on how the world should be that characters are forced to reexamine their prejudices and beliefs . <p> My wife had it right . If Ryan had never met Natalie ( Anna Kendrick ) , his relationship with Alex would still be going . That is exactly the role an Influence Character is supposed to play on the Main Character of a story . Influence Characters represent the fourth source of conflict that many unthinkingly blend with the Relationship Story . They enter the story and shine a light on whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naive assessments of how life should be are actually powerful catalysts for Ryans growth . They argue back and forth over it , but eventually she begins to break through his stubborn attitude . It is precisely his relationship with her that forces him to grow to a point where he finally changes and ditches his conference for Alex . <h> The Best Film of 2009 <p> Academy Awards aside , the best story of 2009 belongs to Up In The Air . Clever thematic connections , a strong Influence Character and a meaningful ending all contributed towards the success of this film . Through this strongly crafted structure , the authors were able to give audiences an experience they cant get in real lifenamely , the opportunity to see both inside and outside of themselves . <p> Up In The Air was trying to say something about the problems we face in our daily lives and how best to go about solving them . And while it may be a painful process at first , at least from a personal standpoint , it might be just the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If only more films were as deeply meaningful as this one . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> In trying to nail down the storyform for this story , the first thing that stands out is the Objective Story Issue . When it comes to showing the detrimental effects of cold impersonal technology replacing humans , Expediency is the one Issue that leaps out . While firing by Internet might not be the right thing to do , it certainly is the most Expedient . It seems clear that this was what the story was aboutthe Expediency of modern business vs. the Need of the recently laid-off to be treated with respect . <p> When it comes to Ryans personal issues with his backpack and all , the Doubt quad stands out . Evaluation , Reevaluation , Production and Reduction seemed to speak of his character more than any other . Ryan suffers from a pessimistic attitude ( another way to look at Doubt ) and his drive to empty out his backpack screams Reduction . <p> Its comforting then to see that Reduction was also in the Expediency quad . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same as the Objective Story Problem . Selecting Reduction as the Problem for locked in the storyform , forcing a Solution of Production for both Ryans Throughline and the Objective Story Throughline . This works nicely in the OS Throughline with Craig wanting his best producers in the air and , of course , with Ryan and his belief that there was something more there with Alex than there really was . Another way to look at Production is to think of it as people who " make a mountain out of a molehill . " Certainly , this phrase could accurately describe Ryan at the end of the film . <p> With these elements set into place , the other throughlines lined up nicely . The Relationship Story is basically a mentoring session ( RS Concern of Learning ) between the hardened veteran and the wide-eyed newbie . And Natalie herself seems most concerned with the situation with her ex-fiance and the fact that she is n't living the 23-year old life she thought she would be ( IC Concern of Present ) .

Be on the lookout for the traditional " You and I " moment wherein Main Character Columbus discovers that he and Impact Character Tallahassee are much more alike than he had previously thought . One complaint , it seems to drag a bit in the middle as the Overall Story thread ( Getting to Pacific Playland ) is put on hold . Thankfully , its character development they spend the time on instead , but the film runs short as it is ( 87 minutes ) . Perhaps weaving in some Zombie killing throughout that development would have kept the story focused and allowed the audience to enjoy more of what they showed up for in the first place . Regardless , this infraction is minor and overshadowed by the sheer fun of the whole piece . Must see for fans of story .

When done right , as it is with this film , the story engine leaves a lasting impression of the message the Authors hoped to convey . <p> When screenwriting gurus or even screenwriters themselves discuss story structure they often focus on " willful protagonists " and " progressive complications " and " powerful image systems . " What they rarely explore , however , is why these things even exist in the first place . Why do stories have acts ? Why do characters have arcs ? Isnt it worth exploring the answers to these questions ? <h> Structure and Meaning <p> Story structure developed as a means of communicating the appropriate way to solve problems . Stories are about solving problems . Acts , scenes , characters , genreall of these are tools for arguing the right solution that would solve these problems . This , of course , assumes that the Authors intention was to use film to argue a certain point-of-view . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Do n't  Know Jack is one of these films . <p> In YDKJ , problems exist because of a preponderance of protection , i.e. everyone is trying to save someone else ( whether they want it or not ) . Dr. Kevorkian is trying to save the elderly and infirm from suffering through a slow and painful death . Likewise , the conservative prosecutor Dick Thompson and his like-minded constituents feel driven to protect the very same elderly and sick from losing their souls to " Dr. Death . " <p> These two forces clash in a way that would not happen if everyone was n't driven to save . If the characters in the story would simply back off and not take any action , the problems would work themselves out . <p> This can be seen midway through the film when the assistant prosecutor turns to Thompson and refuses to press any charges . From there on , conflict between the two warring parties cools down . If this approach was somehow maintained , the problems in the story would have remained resolved and the story would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens . <p> With the broadcasting of Youks procedure on 60 Minutes , the prosecutor is re-energized to protect his constituents and takes Kevorkian to court once again . <h> Good Guys and Protagonists <p> YDKJ is a tragedy and by that I mean a story where the good guys lose and the Main Character ends up feeling unresolved ( More about this particular brand of story structure can be found in my article on writing tragedies ) . Regardless of your personal feelings on the matter , in this story , Kevorkian is the " good guy . " <p> Without a doubt , screenwriter Adam Mazer and director Barry Levinson consider Kevorkian the good guy and Thompson and his religious-zealot cronies as the bad guys . If there is one complaint to be had about the film it is how unevenly balanced the euthanasia argument is . We know that Thompson and his crew are the bad guys ( if for no other reason than their gold-plated elephant lapel pins ) , but unfortunately they get less than their fare share of equal screen time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger if one side wasnt shown to be so adamantly crazy . <p> In 99.999% of all stories the good guys are also the Protagonists . This film is no exception . Kevorkian is the Protagonist in pursuit of the larger Story Goalthat of convincing everyone of the idea that euthanasia should be a basic human right . Protagonists always pursue the goal , Antagonists prevent it . Thompson and Co. are the " bad guys " and thus , the Antagonists of this piece . <p> Kevorkian fights the good fight , has his victories here and there , but ultimately loses the battle and fails to accomplish the greater goal . What is most fascinating about this ( and the impetus for writing this analysis ) is that it is his transformational change at the end of the story that leads to that ultimate failure . In other words , he was on the right track for success , but because of the storys events he ended up taking the wrong approach . <h> Positive Transformations <p> More often than not when a Main Character changes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matrix . In both those films , the Main Characters transformation is the key to solving the larger problems affecting everyone . Luke stops testing himself all the time ( " I 'm not such a bad pilot myself " ) and begins trusting in the Forcethe Death Star explodes . Neo stops doubting himself and begins to believe he is the OneAgent Smith and friends are defeated . This is the natural order of things when it comes to Hollywood blockbusters . <p> The dynamics are different when the Main Characters change results in the story ending in failure . <h> Tragic Transformations <p> In his role as Protagonist , Kevorkian constantly pushes the idea that you just cant sit around and do nothing when people are suffering . True , he was driven to protect others but what he focused on in the larger scheme of things was this notion that doing nothing can not be an option . If he had n't  changed , this methodology would have led to success , i.e. the idea of euthanasia would have been embraced as a human right . Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is where an audience finds meaning within the ending of a story and why the storys structure supports that argument . It is also why I believe this film will touch many emotionally . Its something more than simply a biopic . Kevorkian had the solution , he was doing the right thing , but his change of character allowed the problem to persist and the tragedy to ensue . The story structure communicates the message that by doing nothing we are ensuring a tragic ending . <p> In tragic stories like this , the Main Character takes that positive element they were using in the larger fight and uses it to temper their own drive . <h> Writing That Inspires <p> This dynamic is no more apparent than in that beautifully acted scene at the end where Kevorkian must decide whether or not to take the stand in his own defense . The dilemma , that choice he must make , is the stuff most screenwriters dream of craftingthe classic Leap-of-Faith scene no less meaningful than Lukes decision whether or not to turn off his targeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they cant determine which approach to take . <p> And that 's why Pacinos performance is so awesome in this scene : he had something meaningful to work from . If the story had been structured poorly , or that decision pointless , that scene would have had less of an impact . But it does n't  . Pacino masterfully struggles with it because he knows what that decision ultimately means . <p> When Kevorkian chooses not to take the stand , he is in essence saying that he is giving up the fight . He is no longer letting the drive to protect dictate his actions , and he is intentionally not doing anything as a way of resolving those deep psychological issues he had because of his experience with his mother . <p> By taking that characteristic , that solution to everyones problems out of the mix , he allows the " bad guys " to win . This is where structure elevates acting and where films move beyond simple devices of entertainment . <h> Writing Something Meaningful <p> If you have something to say , effective story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't  Know Jack clearly show that there is more to storytelling than story room catchphrases .

This forces a Solution of Inaction for both and is the key to understanding the meaning behind Kevorkians change at the end of the film . That Crucial Element of Inaction is moved from the Objective Story into the Main Characters throughline . This has the effect of dampering the Main Characters drive at the expense of the Objective Story resulting in Failure . This Change , however , does nothing to resolve Kevorkians angst and thus results in a Story Judgment of Bad . Failure/Bad = Tragedy . <p> Interestingly enough , YDKJ shares the same Objective Story Issue as Up In The Air : Expediency .

Up In The Air explores replacing the human touch with the convenience of the Internet and You Do n't  Know Jack explores using euthanasia to save the dying .

Like The Hurt Locker from last year , a complete story structure exists but it is barely painted in there . John Goodmans character is the closest thing to an alternative perspective , although Kevorkians sister supplies some of that as well . Their argument though does n't  really kick in until the scene with the old Navy man and attempt to conserve gas . While it may not have been historically accurate , bringing that argument about protecting themselves in earlier would have made the story stronger .

In other words , it becomes less of an effective tool for writers trying to create a story . <h> Protagonists who Teach , Main Characters who Learn <p> In addition , there are times when it seems like Heroes could be both learners and teachers . Amelie ( in the aptly titled Amelie ) exists as a teaching Hero . Her gentle manipulations of those in her social circle result in the majority of them re-evaluating their situation in life , each finding a relative sense of harmony . Yet she also learns to reassess her own anti-social behavior through her relationship with Mr. Glass . <p> Is Amelie a teaching Hero or a learning Hero ? <p> One could say both , but in doing would lessen the usefulness of such categorizing . The problem is that Amelie is both Protagonist and Main Character . When looking at her in terms of her objective role as a Protagonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in terms of her subjective role as Main Character she operates as a " learner . " And while it is clear that the Protagonist is not always the Main Character , in these situations when it is , the idea of splitting Heroes into learners or teachers becomes less functional . <h> One Changes While the Other Stands Their Ground <p> Within a complete story , two approaches towards solving the problem at hand exist : one by the central character of the piece ( often called the Hero , but more accurately as the Main Character ) and the other by another character who develops a significant relationship with the first . Both approaches to problem-solving battle it out act by act until the end when one changes to adopt the others paradigm . This is what is going on when people speak of the " arc " of a character . <p> Covered in more depth within the series on Meaningful Endings , the answers to these questions contain the Author 's Proof or message of the piece . Instead of determining whether the Hero/Main Character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character development helps to support the Authors position . Stories are less about characters learning something , and more about an Author trying to argue the efficacy of a particular approach . <h> A Matter of Resolve <p> Instead of looking at Heroes as either teaching or learning , it is far more accurate to look at them in terms of their final resolve . Do they change and adopt a new way of approaching problems or do they stand their ground and forge ahead ? If they do maintain their approach , it will be that other significant character they developed a relationship with that will change . This is how an argument blossoms through narrative fiction . <p> Suddenly , films that do n't  fit the learning/teaching paradigm make sense . In Winters Bone , did Ree ( Jennifer Lawrence ) teach anybody anything ? No . But she did stand her ground in her efforts to find her missing father , and in doing managed to influence her uncle Teardrop ( John Hawkes ) to change his approach . In Amadeus , did Salieri teach those around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw those efforts to the end . In that tragedy it was Mozart who changed his approach , working himself to his own early grave . <h> Developing a Story With Accuracy <p> Thinking in terms of a learning Hero or a teaching Hero is n't necessarily wrong . In some contexts ( family films ) this approach might seem helpful . Within all stories , regardless of genre or intended audience , thinking in terms of the Main Characters final resolve offers greater accuracy . This concept of story structure applies to any story or piece of fiction that intends a deeper meaning . <p> The problem is that the converse is not always true . Change Main Characters do not always learn something ( Ed Exley in L.A. Confidential , William Munny in Unforgiven ) . And Steadfast Main Characters do not always teach ( Randy the Ram in The Wrestler , Mr. Incredible in The Incredibles ) . As usual , the objectivity of Dramatica encompasses all fiction by providing a solid touch point from which to build a story .

It does , however , provide an explanation as to why Acts exist , why there seem to be four of them in every complete narrative , and helps shed light on the order of the thematic material for each of these major movements . <p> The theory also provides a clear distinction between when things happen within a story and when they reveal themselves to the Audience . <p> It 's when are you giving a piece of information to the audience so that they have " it 's how are you dolling out the information to the audience to get the best sense of what your story is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captures the complex process of problem-solving and distills it down to an arrangement of story points.4 This process , represented by the Signposts beneath each throughline , relies on the order of these story points to convey its conclusion .

If anyone comes at you using the MacGuffin as an explanation for why something is the way it is in a story , do yourself a favor and run . <p> Run as fast as you can because that person has no idea what is really going on inside of a meaningful story and arguing with them will prove to be as daunting as proving to the Flat Earth Society that our planet is in fact , round . <p> But what about Hitchcock , maaaan ? How could you possibly say anything bad about the master ? ! <p> True , it was Hitchcock who originally brought this ridiculous story concept to light but really , how often in life do you find masters of their artform who can describe exactly what it is they are doing ? There is no doubt that Hitch believed in the MacGuffin , but there is also no doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards to the mechanics of story . Masters often do n't  understand what it is they do , they just do . <h> The History <p> Hitchcock was an eclectic filmmaker , one given to nonsensical endings that often left the meaning of the film up to the audience . More often than not though , an author is not after this result . The drive to write is more often than not accompanied by a desire to say something meaningful . This is where the MacGuffin fails . <p> a plot element that catches the viewers attention or drives the plot of a work of fiction . the specific nature of the MacGuffin is unimportant to the plot , and the MacGuffin can sometimes be ambiguous , completely undefined , generic or left open to interpretation Commonly , though not always , the MacGuffin is the central focus of the film in the first act , and later declines in importance as the struggles and motivations of characters play out . Sometimes the MacGuffin is even forgotten by the end of the film . <p> In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> It might be a Scottish name , taken from a story about two men in a train . One man says " What 's that package up there in the baggage rack ? " , and the other answers " Oh that 's a McGuffin " . The first one asks " What 's a McGuffin ? " . " Well " , the other man says , " Its an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands " . The first man says " But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands " , and the other one answers " Well , then that 's no McGuffin ! " . So you see , a McGuffin is nothing at all . <p> That , coupled with the explanation that the term may have originated with Hitchcocks friend and screenwriter Angus MacPhail , and it quickly becomes apparent that the concept of the MacGuffin was , and always will be , a joke . Its a nonsensical term made up by two friends in a story meeting to help them get to page ten . Why anyone would attribute authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On the other hand , if one wants to write something meaningless , the MacGuffin is your tool . <h> MacGuffins That Really Are n't  MacGuffins <p> Defenders of the MacGuffin always point to Casablanca and the letters of transit . Their argument is that the drive to attain those letters simply starts the story off . They believe the letters only purpose is to provide the catalyst or Inciting Incident of the piece and that eventually they fall away in importance to the storys message . <p> Nothing could be further from the truth . <p> In Casablanca problems exist because there are two letters of transit that have gone missing , letters of transit that Victor Laszlo was going to use to get to America . Everyone in Casablanca is concerned with these letters , and it is in fact their actions or lack of action towards these letters that argues the logical side of the authors message . Ugarte has ( or had ) his own nefarious plans for them , Laszlo and Ilsa want them , the refugees will do anything for them ( even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants them returned , Ferrari offers to buy them , and so on . Everyone has their own selfish interests at heart when it comes to these letters and it is this selfishness that creates the problems in the world of Casablanca . Overcoming that selfishness is the key towards achieving the Storys Goal . <p> The letters of transit are not simply a plot device to get the ball rolling . They are , in fact , the Goal of the story and the reason why problems exist for everyone . Once Laszlo recovers them , the problems in the big picture story are resolved and the film is over . <p> Some will argue that Casablanca is not about letters of transit , but rather about the romantic relationship between Rick and Ilsa . The truth of the matter is that Casablanca is both a love story between Rick and Ilsa AND a story about a resistance leader trying to escape the Nazis . The former is the heart of the story , the latter is the head of the story ( the logical argument ) . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for why the film stands the test of time . Complete stories incorporate both head and heart into one meaningful statement giving us an opportunity to experience problems both from within , and from without . <p> You cant have the head without the heart and you cant have the heart without the head . Asserting that the head falls away in importance can only be argued by someone who does n't  have a head . <h> Even the French Get It <p> Story is universal . Because story is an argument and because we all have the same brains ( more or less ) between our ears , the mechanism to argue our points effectively is the same regardless of point of origin . Sure , there might be some noise due to cultural differences , but at the base of it all , the process is the same . <p> In Amelie the story starts off when young disassociated Amelie discovers a box of childrens toys hidden behind the wall in her bathroom . MacGuffinees would have you believe that this discovery was simply a plot device to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that , like the letters of transit , the box of toys had little to do with the rest of the story . <p> Once again , they would be dead wrong . <p> In Amelie problems exist because people have negatively evaluated their situation in life . The jealous ex-boyfriend with the cassette recorder , the unsuccessful writer , and the brow-beaten store clerkeach one of these characters is suffering because they 're stuck with a negative assessment of their lot in life . Getting them to reevaluate their lives , and see things in a positive light is the Goal of the story , a Goal pursued by the protagonist of the story , Amelie . <p> So sparking the imagination of the original owner of the toy box is more than simply a " plot device , " it is the first test , the first proof-of-concept that what Amelie wants to do , can be done . It is tied thematically with the issues facing every other character in the story . It also explains why , in the end , the scene of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grandson is buttressed up against the scene of the writer seeing his words posted in public . By re-evaluating their lives ( through Amelies influence ) the characters in the story have overcome their own individual problems . <p> The box of toys has a significant place in the overall meaning of the story . <h> When the MacGuffin Works <p> When the MacGuffin is used as prescribed , the result is a story disaster . While The Maltese Falcon certainly has an important part in the history of cinema , it has no place in the halls of lasting and meaningful storytelling . The story , simply put , is broken . Part of this can be ascribed to its use of the Maltese Falcon itself as the MacGuffin . <p> Unlike Casablanca , finding the Maltese Falcon is NOT the Story Goal . If it was , then once it is revealed to be a fake , the problems in the story would be resolved and the film would be over . This is not the case . <p> In fact , the story is not over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the real Goal of the story , one that is purused by the Protagonist of the piece , Sam . The quest for the falcon gets things going , but has little to do with where the film ends up . Its a perfect MacGuffin . <p> The Maltese Falcon , in sharp contrast to the childrens box of toys in Amelie or the letters in Casablanca has absolutely nothing to do with the meaning of the film . It is , as Hitchcock prescribes , a nonsensical unimportant plot device that simply starts the ball rolling . As such , it contributes to the general confusion towards what the film is truly about and breaks any trust the audience placed with the author . Misdirection is fine if the end result is some greater meaning . Misdirection because one does n't  understand story leads to ambiguous and forgettable fare . <h> Wrapup <p> If left unconvinced , take note that master storyteller George Lucas described R2-D2 as : <p> the main driving force of the moviewhat you say in the movie business is the MacGuffinthe object of everybodys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain his stories , then you know it has to be a broken story concept . To be fair , he does state that the MacGuffin has more importance than Hitchcock attributed to it , but reallyR2D2 the driving force of Star Wars ? That would imply that once R2 is found , the story would be over . Add to this ridiculousness , the fact that the prequels were storytelling disasters and this whole fascination with the MacGuffin seems clear . <p> It is a tool used by those who do n't  fully understand why and how stories work . <p> Sometimes , in the case of Hitchcock , this misunderstanding has little to no effect on the final product . His films are masterpieces that , when their stories do n't  work , overcome this weakness with talent and panache not seen in many filmmakers . <p> In the case of Lucas though , it becomes clear that this concept needs to be put to rest . The MacGuffin is a joke . And in the same way we laugh at our ancestors who used to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in wait at the edge of the ocean , we need to have one hearty last laugh at this concept and then erase it from our collective memories . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> What most people do n't  realize when they 're talking about the MacGuffin is that the films they are referring to are actually stories with an Objective Story Goal of Obtaining .

These last two films have completely different Story Goals that have nothing to do with Obtaining . <p> This is where Authors get in trouble .

Apply them to the entire canon and the error only compounds . For what does it mean if these concepts of story structure can so easily shift from one context to the next with little to no effect on their essential meaning ? <p> Rather , one should see structure less as a template of touch points and more as a carrier wave for what it is the Author wants to say with their work .

So prevalent is this disconnect between what happened and what it means that those introduced to the series midway find themselves lost and wondering why the rabid fanbase even exists . <p> Strangely enough the first and certainly most juvenile in the series , Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone , comes closest to providing audiences with something meaningful , i.e. a complete story . Complete stories are those works of fiction that endeavor to argue a certain approach to solving problems . In fact , when appreciated within the context of the entire series , that first film lays out a samplera blueprintof the meaning that is to come . Misunderstandings run rampant . A Main Character with an ability to do and say things that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good-hearted friend who encourages the boy to finish his task at hand . And most importantly , a relationship between the two built up of compromises and untold adjustments , a collaboration with the sole purpose of figuring out how best the two can work together . <p> Fans of the series may find it difficult to set this fourth story line within the context of The Sorcerers Stone . All seven books ? Sure . But only the first ? The misunderstandings surrounding Hagrid and what he took from Gringotts Vault resonates . As does the definition of Harrys special powers that result in his alienation . The resolute friend could be Ron , or Hermione or Hagrid , but how they end up influencing Harry beyond simple cheerleading becomes less clear . That fourth and most important bit of story , howeveran emotional argument between the twoclearly does n't  exist at all . Not with Ron . Not with Hermione . And not with Hagrid . <h> An Incomplete Story Agreed Upon <p> This was the challenge that a group of us faced several years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the Dramatica theory of story as context ( naturally ) , we found it difficult to identify the true heart of the story . In Dramatica terms , this emotional core of a complete story concerns itself with the relationship between the Main Character and the Influence Character . This second character impacts or challenges the Main Character to reassess the way they see the world , and to possibly change the way he or she goes about living . Key to this character is the emotional argument that develops between the two opposing approaches , defined by their unique relationship . Without this key argument , a story lacks the fullness or completeness that people look for when they come to a story . <p> Harry Potter overcame his angst of being different within that first book , yet how he managed to get there fails to develop in an emotionally logical fashion . Typically this development plays out within that special relationship between Main and Impact Character . The two characters battle back and forth until one capitulates . Harrys acceptance of his new home , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipped , rather than the meaningful end to an emotional argument . <h> One Complete Work that Simply Works <p> We deemed Sorcerers Stone a tale at that meeting , not a story . Close , but no cigar . Tales tell a series of events culminating in an ending . Stories juxtapose alternate viewpoints resulting in meaningful resolution . Both tale and story entertain and entrance , yet only one gives more than the sum of its parts . Sorcerers Stone clearly fulfilled the aspects of an entertaining tale , but lacked the emotional resonance found in a complete story . <p> The series as a whole turns out to be a completely different story . <p> Taken as one body of work , that steadfast friend becomes less a cheerleader , and more a meaningful opposer driven to help the boy realize his full potential . Understanding why a Main Character needs that different point-of-view , it is clear to see that Severus Snape ( Alan Rickman ) is the Impact Character of the Harry Potter series . The relationship between Harry and Severus the true heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the final film carries such an enormous emotional punch behind it is because it makes clear Rowlings message . Instead of simply a collection of entertaining tales , the Harry Potter series argues a particular way of solving problems . That final chapter , that revelation of Snapes true character , crystalizes the Authors original intent . <p> Snapes love for Lilly was so great , so deep , that he was willing to accept all the hatred and suspicion of dark motives in order to protect her only son . He was willing to be whatever he needed to be . This attitude , and Harrys final knowledge of it , was the only thing that could have influenced The Boy Who Lived to finally accept his own death at the hands of Voldemort . The friendships Harry created along the wayRon , Hermione , Hagrid , even Dumbledorewere important , yet only one relationship rode the carrier wave of meaningful story structure . One relationship carried the heart of Rowlings argument . <p> Dropping that Resurrection Stone sealed Harrys emotional bond with Snape : two people willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones they loved . The tears that appear during that Penseive sequence come not as a recognition of the sadness of the situation , but rather with the understanding that sometimes this is the only way one can win . Our acceptance of this message and the waves of emotion that accompany it exist only as a result of one human mind ( the Author ) trying to convey meaning to another ( The Audience ) . Our hearts harmonize with our minds , simultaneously recognizing what the events within the greater story meant . <h> Meaningful Story Structure <p> Only a complete story , one designed to argue the appropriateness of a certain approach to solving problems , can achieve this kind of emotional resonance . Inciting Incidents , Midpoints and Fun and Games moments certainly have some relevance , but the real structure behind story strives to give audiences something they cant achieve in real life : meaning . The fact that it took 1,090,739 words or 1033 minutes to do so within the Harry Potter series only magnifies that reality . <p> Story structure as understood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nights of the Soul exist because Protagonists need a down moment from which to bring themselves back up .

The Dramatica theory of story has much to say about the construction of stories , yet always with the express purpose of clarifying the Authors original intent . The Harry Potter saga as written postulates a particular point-of-view on how best to approach certain problems . When faced with an ability to do something no one else can , one must free themselves from their own ego . Give up whatever one desires . Only then , can one triumph over Evil . <p> The relationship between Harry Potter and Severus Snape proved this argument true .

The greater the level of accuracy on the part of the writer , the greater the experience for the audience . <p> As with the article last week regarding why Everything Is Not a Heros Journey , there also exists a certain group of people that seem to think many popular Protagonists are really just carbon-copies of one another . To them , every central character in a story is simply another evolution of Gilgamesh . <p> Now , to a certain extent , they are right . <p> Both Neo ( Keanu Reeves ) in The Matrix and Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamil ) in Star Wars fulfill the role of the classic Archetypal Protagonist ; that is , they are the ones who are pursuing the successful resolution of the storys primary goal .

Both Neo ( Keanu Reeves ) in The Matrix and Luke Skywalker in Star Wars easily fit into these generalized observations regarding story . But that 's just itthey lack specificity . Not only are these concepts of story useless to a writer in figuring out exactly what to do with their story , they also prove to be ultimately detrimental because of their blatant inaccuracies . <p> Constructing a storya meaningful storyis a hard and demanding process .

Whether it be some deep psychological issue from when they were a child , or something that just happened to them yesterday , this personal issueor problemis what motivates them to participate in the larger entity that is a story . <p> In The Matrix , Thomas Andersen ( Neo ) suffers from a preponderance of disbelief , both in himself and in the world around him . When asked by Morpehus to climb out on the ledge in order to escape Agent Smith , Thomas does n't  get very far before turning around . " I cant do this , " he claims as he cowers back inside .

This drive to test himself at every turn was Lukes major personal problem . <p> Clearly these two characters are coming from two different places . <p> Luke never had a problem believing in the Force ; he was on-board with the whole thing from the moment he lost his aunt and uncle . Likewise , Neo did n't  create problems because he felt this need to test himself all the time ; if left to his own devices he probably would have still been there camped out in front of his computer screen . <p> They both were motivated by two distinct and separate problems . <p> Why does this matter ? <h> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Test requires trust . <p> Thomas Andersen eventually grows to a point where he can begin believing that he is , indeed , Neo . Faith resolves his issues . Luke eventually grows to a point where he is willing to let go . Trusting in the Force resolves his issues . Both characters managed to resolve their individual problems by using the correct solution for the issues that plagued them . <p> Now , at first glance , faith may seem an awful lot like trust .

Luke needed to simply trust in this otherworldly " force " for the torpedoes to hit their mark . <p> Why then is it so important to delineate the exact nature of the problem in a story ? <h> The Problem Defines the Story <p> The Main Characters problem represents the finest level of granularity from which one can appreciate the true meaning of a story . That 's why an exploration of it can so often seem like splitting hairs .

If for some reason these two problems are at odds ( the external and internal ) , the Main Character may seem out of place , or worse , inconsequential to the resolution of the story . <p> In addition , there will be a discrepancy between the kinds of goals in stories with dissimilar problems . Problems of belief will naturally lead to goals focused on accomplishing some insurmountable task . Problems of trust organically lend themselves to goals more focused on simply doing something . Like the distinction between faith and trust , the distinction between acquiring something and doing something is a very important one . <p> This is why Luke would not have fit into the story that was The Matrix , and why Neo would have had a hard time finding a home amongst the inhabitants of Star Wars .

Neo was the lynch-pin for the successful achievement of that goal because the one thing that would allow them to gain that controlunwavering beliefwas an important factor of Neos character development . <p> Luke , as described above , had no problem with believing . Trying to replace Neo with Luke would have broken the logic of the story structure and diminished any appreciable meaning . <p> In Star Wars there was no attempt to gain control over the Empire or the tyrannical systems they employed .

These two characters are simply not interchangeable . <h> The Need for Clarity in Storytelling <p> Not every story is the same . There are tens of thousands of different meaningful story structures , each with its own unique perspective on why things are the way they are . And because each unique story structure requires a specific kind of central character , it follows that there are just as many variations of Main Character . <p> The Matrix was trying to prove how having more faith can lead to greater happiness , while Star Wars was trying to prove that trusting in something other than yourself is the way to go .

To be inaccurate on even the smallest of matters is to invite failure in the construction of the story at large and a breakdown in the communication of the message the Author hopes to send . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> When it comes to Genre , both Star Wars and The Matrix are the same . Genre here refers to the alignment of each throughline with its corresponding Domain , not the commonly accepted use of genre that uses labels like romantic-comedy or sci-fi action flick . Genre in a Dramatica sense describes the overall feeling of a story and within this context , yes , both films are similar . <p> Both have Main Characters in the Universe Domain ( Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined to save them all ) . Both have Objective Stories in the Physics Domain ( Star Wars has light-sword battles and interstellar dogfights , The Matrix has kung-fu and bullet-dodging ) . Both have Impact Characters in the Mind Domain ( Obi-Wan with his steadfast belief in the Force , Morpheus with his unwavering belief in the power of the human mind ) . And finally both have Relationship Stories in the Psychology Domain ( both feature mentor/mentee relationships wherein the mentor is trying to manipulate the mentee into thinking of the world around them in a different light ) . <p> But that 's where the similarities between the two stories cease . <p> Star Wars has a Main Character Problem of Test and an Objective Story Goal of Doing . The Matrix has a Main Character Problem of Disbelief and an Objective Story Goal of Obtaining . Right there , it is easy to see how Luke and Neo are not the same characters and therefore can not be easily interchanged . You cant have a Main Character with a Problem of Disbelief in a story about Doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This extends throughout the storyform . The Objective Story Consequences are different : Failure to fight the Empire will lead the Rebels to living a life under oppression ( Objective Story Consequence of Being ) , while failure to gain control over the Matrix will allow the machines to continue transforming humans into batteries ( Objective Story Consequence of Becoming ) . <p> Even the individual thematic Issues the two of them face will be different : Luke struggles with the apparent realities of the world around him and his tendency toward delusions , both good and bad , about himself and others ( Main Character Issue of Fantasy ) , while Neo struggles with his preconceptions of the world he inhabits and his willingness to reevaluate them ( Main Character Issue of Openness ) . <p> The differences keep piling up so high that eventually the argument that both are really simply extensions of the monomythic hero begin to appear ridiculous at best . Stories are complicated yet sophisticated beasts , they deserve as much then in our understanding of them . 
@@119272783 @8272783/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> The True Champion of Chinatown <h> The identity of the real Protagonist in this narrative will shock you . <p> Lurking within the darkness of 1930s Los Angeles a lone figure shifts in and out of trouble , his purpose solid and true . A heavy responsibilitythat of bringing balance to an unfortunate situationweighs firmly on his shoulders . While hidden forces others work to prevent his success , this mans relentless pursuit of a favorable outcome continues without hesitation . <p> Certainly we speak of Jake Gittes ( Jack Nicholson ) , the headstrong investigator situated at the center of Roman Polanskis 1974 classic Chinatown . As Protagonist , Jake fulfills the duty of being the character motivated to pursue a successful resolution of the storys central problem . But is the hidden nature of the familial relationships within this film truly the source of trouble for everyone or is there something more at stake here ? When does this story actually begin and what does that say about when it ends ? <p> The answers to these questions may she 'd some light on who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not Jake who fits the description . Perhaps there is a better candidate . <h> Bringing character into focus <p> Search out alternative perspectives on Protagonist or Main Character and you 're likely to come up with a mish-mash of incomplete and juvenile descriptions : the character who the story is about , the one who undergoes the biggest change or worse , simply the hero . Gross approximations that lead to dismissals that eventually lead to continued ignorance . No true definition because no one takes into account perspective . <p> If one looks at a story from a truly objective viewpoint , one can identify a central problem that begs for a solution . One character pursues that resolution while another prevents it . The first rightly deserves the name Protagonist , the second Antagonist ( as covered in Protagonist and Antagonist : Beyond Hero and Villain ) . Names and personal issues have no stake here as this is a removed , third person point-of-view onto a story . Complete objectivity . <p> Stepping within and taking a personal subjective viewpoint , it becomes clear there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . We empathize with this character as we become intimately familiar with their personal issues , sometimes to the point of blindness . The Sixth Sense and The Others play with this reality of story by placing us squarely in the center of ill-conceived perceptions . From here , subjectivity easily breeds misunderstandinga reality that will become more important as this analysis of Chinatown continues . <h> Forget it , Jake <p> Chinatown is a wonderful example of storyweaving at its finest . What " seems " to be going on is almost entirely hidden until the very end of the film , and when the proper context is finally provided everything is different that it had appeared . <p> This is that subjectivity of the Main Character point-of-view at work . Jake appears to be the Protagonist of the film because we are never granted an objective view of things until the very end . This is not Star Wars or Braveheart where the big picture comes into view consistently and often . Occasionally moments exist where the figureheads of Noah Cross or Hollis Mulray come into play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus subject to that same error of perception . Almost 90% of the film reveals itself through the Main Characters point-of-view . Ninety percent left open to subjective interpretation . <p> To Jake , and thus to us , figuring out what is going on becomes the central Goal of the story and thus , seems to be the Goal of the Protagonist . The initial manipulation and the consequent investigationpiecing together the glasses , the rifle-wielding farmers , the land-owning old folksall of this comes together in support of Jakes quest for an answer as to why . <p> Eventually he does find an answer , but does this really resolve the storys problem ? <h> Resolution and the Protagonist <p> Stepping back and taking an objective view of the storys events , it becomes clear what resolution is needed . The story of Chinatown begins when a public official refuses to build a new dam forcing his business partner , a rich and powerful man , to craft a scandal . This initial decision by the public official , based on a concern for making amends for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To resolve this problem balance must be restored to the state of affairs . <p> Only one man works for this successful outcomeand it is not Jake . <p> Noah Cross ( John Huston ) the rich and powerful man behind the scenespursues a course of action that would bring his family back together and bring the San Fernando Valley to Los Angeles . He pursues a course of action that would resolve Mulrays refusal to build . <p> Noahs success arrives with Jakes decision to let it go . Only then can the annexation continue unabated . Only then can balance be restored . Only then can grandfather cradle granddaughter in his loving arms . <p> Only then can the Protagonist claim victory . <h> Unintended consequences of stellar writing <p> Ask Robert Towne who he thought the Protagonist or Antagonist of Chinatown was and he would probably respond with the obvious : Jakes the Protagonist , Noah Cross the Antagonist . The answer would come without hesitation . However , many writers will tell you that they began a story with a certain purpose in mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intent does not discount the subconscious . <p> Ask Stephen King if he purposefully crafted The Shawshank Redemption to explore the problems inherent in the implicit support of authority both from an objective view with Andys journey and a subjective view with Reds journey and you would be banned from the state of Maine . Likewise , had you asked Bill Shakespeare if he understood that the only solution to Hamlets incessant thinking was the Danes acceptance of his uncles truly " evil " nature you would have been tied to the stake and burned as a heretic . Regardless of what they had in mind when they first set out , these authors crafted great stories that effectively explored the human minds problem-solving process . <p> Robert Towne did the same . <p> Is this a case of making more out of Chinatown than what is really there ? Could be . But it also could provide a concrete reason as to why this film has endured so long and why it always ends up at the top of everyones list . Chinatown works on a level even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clashing objective against subjective , providing an understanding unattainable in daily life . <h> Shifting perspectives grants meaning <p> The only way to truly understand something is to see it both from within and without . This is the power of stories and the unfortunate shortcoming of our own existence . We can never truly be objective about our own subjective experience . Given both perspectivesas in all great storiesone can truly appreciate a problem in its entirety . <p> Chinatown plays with this reality of context by only providing the subjective point-of-view . By hiding the true Goal of the storythe healing of shattered familial and territorial/economic relationshipswe fall easily into the trap of failing to see the forest for the trees . We fall into the trap of rooting for Jake when in fact were rooting for someone else . <p> And that 's when the disgust sets in . <h> The shock of a new context <p> The private investigators decision to look the other way brings success to the rich mans efforts . Free to do as he pleases , this powerful man can now merge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the history of Southern California . A resolution to Mulrays initial refusal . <p> But that 's not the part that repulses us . <p> The land grab was never about the money . Noah Cross tells us as much when he reveals to Jake that what its really about is the future . Annexing the valley has more to do with securing the road to come more than it does with increasing Noahs already massive fortune . Making amendsrestoring familial relationships , not simply revealing themrequires a reliable future . Thus , annexation becomes simply a stepping a stone , a requirement for the real goal of the story . <p> What exactly does restoring the family bond entail ? Noahs daughter , Evelyn Mulray was only 50% of himself . His granddaughter , by virtue of her birth was only 75% . A great granddaughter born of his granddaughter ? well , you do the math . <p> This familythis legacy of Noah Crosswas in fact , the state of affairs he was after . And this is precisely why that ending feels so sick and repulsive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally would disapprove of . Protagonists solve problems . As much as we may hate him , Noah Cross healed the broken situation at the core of Chinatown . <p> As an Audience member experiencing this story we instinctively want to cheer in much the same way we did when the Death Star exploded or when Agent Smith burst from within . Morally , many of us may sit in disgust , but the argument of the story has been presented so well and so concretely that we have trouble formulating a counter-position . We buy in to the fact that this is the way things are , and we sit there dumbfounded , wishing we could somehow " Forget it " as well . <h> Context and conclusion <p> Stories provide us an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem . From an objective context we can see the forces of Protagonist and Antagonist working against each other in regards to the resolution of this problem . In Chinatown this inequity begins with a decision to choose safety over corruption and ends with that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As an Audience member we do not need to empathize with the Goal of a story . Empathy exists only in the subjective view . We care very much about what is going on , we want to understand it every bit as much as Jake does . But objectively , as dispassionate observers , we do n't  care about what transpires . Objectively all that matters is the resolution of the storys initial inequity . <p> Sleight-of-hand storytelling and playing with Audience perception naturally invites illogical plot contrivances and consequently broken stories . Chinatown suffers not from this because of its consistency in maintaining character functions on and off-screen . The objective view works logically even though so much time is spent from within a subjective first-person viewpoint . The objective part of the argument works even without us knowing it . <p> Its only once we are granted the entire picture that we move beyond Jake and understand for ourselves how this was all possible argument being made : Spend too much time understanding why things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption to satiate its own despicable desire . You may personally feel lost and confused at the end of it all , but in the bigger picture the victors will maintain their spoilsand the ability to continue spoiling . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Noah Cross the Protagonist ? From an objective perspective the old man certainly functions as such , yet as an Audience member we rarely get to see enough of him to be sure . It is not like Karen ( Tilda Swinton ) in Michael Clayton where we witness several scenes of her hemming and hawing over what she should do about Arthur ( see The True Definition of a Protagonist ) . Archetypal Protagonists need to weigh the pros and cons ( Consider ) as much as they need to pursue . Cross seeks resolution , yet does little consideration . <p> Some stories deliver characters that do n't  fall easily into archetypal patterns . Chinatown works this way . Preferring complexity over easy identification , these stories mix and match the elements of character to both surprise and delight us . <p> If the Goal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles then Cross certainly fulfills the motivation of Pursuit . His daughter Evelyn then fits in nicely as the one trying to Avoid/Prevent . Furthermore , she does a tremendous amount of Reconsidering which would position her as the Archetypal Antagonist of the story . Again , this runs counter to Audience empathies but the film does weigh more heavily towards the Main Character point-of-view . Jake would then fulfill the motivations of Help and Conscience ( Guardian ) with the hired thugs " Kitty Kat " working as Hinder and Temptation ( Contagonists ) . <p> The above article runs counter to the official Dramatica analysis , yet in some ways explains the storyform more accurately . The Requirement of the Future ( setting up water rights in Los Angeles ) , the OS Solution of Ability ( granting one the ability to commit a reprehensible act ) , even the Goal of the Past ( Mending a Broken Family ) seems to fit better then simply uncovering what has happened . <p> Jake uncovers the familial relationships at the turn of the 3rd structural act ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end where a Goal typically finds resolution . Evelyns decision to tell him the truth propels the Overall Story Signpost of The Future into the final Signpost of the Present ( Story Driver - Decision ) . No longer concerned with where they will live or what will become of Los Angeles , the objective characters are now concerned with how to survive NOW . The past is known , but there is still an entire Act left to play out . The story truly does n't  come to a Successful Outcome until Cross comforts his granddaughter , showing that he is there for her now . <p> In addition , the story does n't  begin with Mulrays decision to refuse to hand Catherine over ( or for that fact his murder ) . That decision happens at the turn of the First Act into the Second . According to the storyform , the first Overall Story Act centers around The Past . With this in mind , it makes more sense to secure Mulrays decision to refuse building the dam as the initial Story Driver ( or Inciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins the conversation over " what has happened " ( the Van Der Lip Dam catastrophe ) . Identifying Noahs decision to use Jake as the initial Story Driver does n't  work as well as it does n't  create an inequity that naturally flows into The Past .

The Antagonist provides one aspect of this opposition . <p> It has been written elsewhere that one of the more unique aspects of Christopher Nolans stellar film Inception is that there is no Antagonist to be found . Dominque Cobb ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) and his merry band of mind thieves operate without being hampered by a discernible evil baddie . Some of have even gone so far as to suggest that its lack of such an important character is a sign of why it is a " bad movie " . <p> Sidestepping the insanity of link-bait , the first step towards understanding who the Antagonist comes with precisely defining the objective function of such a character . <h> The Antagonist prevents the efforts to reach the Story Goal . <p> Since every story is really an intensive look at the problem-solving process that goes on within the human mind , it only makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought after . This resolution is known as the Story Goal and is actively pursued by the Protagonist of a story . <p> The Antagonist wants those efforts to fail . <h> Define the Goal first . Protagonist and Antagonist will follow . <p> In Inception the Story Goal is to get Fischer Jr . ( Cillian Murphy ) to realize he needs to Break Up His Fathers Empire . Everyone in the story has some connection to this Goal , but there is only one person who actively drives the efforts towards it , regardless of consequences , and that 's Dom Cobb . Thus , Cobb is the Protagonist of the piece and when Fischer sits on the shore with who he thinks is Peter Browning ( really its Eames ) and tells his friend the epiphany he has reached , those efforts have ended in Success . The problem has been resolved . <p> So now we know the Goal , and we know the Protagonist . Who then prevents Cobb from reaching this Goal ? <p> The first , and most obvious choice are the heavily-armed agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrusion . Cobb wants in . They want him out . They want failure . Sure , they 're not as sexy or charming as a typical Villain , but then , does every story require such a character ? <h> The Antagonist is not always a Villain . <p> Many make a big deal about how important a Villain is to a work of fiction . Where would Die Hards John McClane be without Hans Gruber ? Or The Dark Knights Batman without the Joker ? Or Potter without Voldemort ? Some would argue that the success of these stories can be attributed in some respect to how prominent and charismatic these Villains are . <p> But the real reason why many feel these baddies are more effective than the subconscious defenders of Inception is because these Villains encapsulate what is known as the Archetpyal Antagonist . Representing not only the drive to prevent the Goal from being reached , but also the drive to force the Protagonist to reconsider such efforts , the Archetypal Antagonist is a more familiar obstacle to general audiences . <p> But the focus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not identifying and utilizing recognizable patterns of storytelling . <h> Complex Characters are not so cut and dried . <p> Complex characters break away from the norm in that they attempt to give the audience something new , something unexpected . The problem with Archetypes is that they often incite a feeling of sameness , an " Ive seen this before " sort of feeling that comes when an audience knows exactly where a character is coming from . Sometimes this predictability is OK , maybe even warranted , but more often than not , it is n't . That 's where Complex Characters come into play . <h> Designing the Unexpected <p> One way of avoiding the tedium of the same comes from dividing up the characteristics of a typical Archetypal Antagonist among different characters . Instead of piling them all up in one comic-booky representation of a bad guy , as is the case with Hans Gruber or the Joker , spread them out in patterns that are unfamiliar or unique to a particular story . <p> In Inception the drive to prevent the Goal from being reached is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly established . However , the drive to force the Protagonist to reconsider the efficacy of their Goalthe other half of the Archetypal Antagonistgoes to Ariadne ( Ellen Page ) . On more than one ocassion , she works diligently to get Cobb to see the error of his ways and perhaps rethink his efforts to resolve the problem . <p> Does Ariadne want the mission to fail ? Up until she 's actually in Fischers mind , she does . Even then , she still continues to badger Cobb , forcing a rethinking that stalls the Protagonist and delays the eventual resolution . Now , she has other characteristics that offset this opposition and prevent her from being seen as a truly " bad guy " , but seen in the context of achieving the Goal of a story , she provides that mental obstacle . <h> An Antagonist also forces the Protagonist to reconsider . <p> Most bad guys , particularly Villains , take on this second characteristic of an Antagonist . Think of Grand Mof Tarkin in Star Wars and his threats of blowing up Alderaan , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed with the sole purpose of getting William Wallace to reconsider his stance on Scotlands freedom . <p> Inception avoids this convention . The problem , of course , is that because the sentries of Fischers minds are only challenging Cobb physically and really do n't  exhibit any other functionality in the story , they can come off as mindless drones . Structurally this is not a problem , but such one-dimensional characters can be a source of consternation and confusion for many . For the rest of us , they fulfilled their dramatic roles with precision and expertise . <h> Fulfilling functions , instead of time-tested patterns <p> The quest for the Antagonist in Inception is simple : identify the Goal and determine who actively prevents it and also who actively forces reconsiderations of such an effort . Both Ariadne and the sentries of Fischers subconscious adequately serve this dramatic function , thus providing the resistance needed to accurately depict the human mind and the process it undergoes in solving a problem . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> In Dramatica , the Archetypal Antagonist is driven by the Motivations of Prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite characteristics of Pursuit and Consider . Archetypal Characters are usually used in simply structured stories that would rather focus on flashy special-effects and action than character development . <p> Inception is rare in that it tries to do both . <p> By splitting up the Motivations of Prevent and Reconsider into different Players , the requirement for a complete story is still met while simultaneously delivering something an audience has not seen before , or at the very least , is not overly familiar with . <p> It should also be made perfectly clear that when speaking about the Protagonist and Antagonist of a story , only the Objectiveor Overall Story Throughlineis considered . Cobbs drive to get back home is certainly another aspect of the story , but one that lies in a different place , namely the Main Character Throughline . Dramatica sees both throughlines occurring in a complete story . One is no more or less important than the other . When trying to determine the Antagonist of a story , it becomes important to focus the attention only on the dispassionate Overall Story as both Antagonist and Protagonist work in this area .

They show upyet ultimately have nothing meaningful to say , in part because they did n't  follow the " rule " . <h> The First Rule of Narrative Science <p> By " rule " , of course , we refer to a standard set when looking at story as an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem . Rather than yet another in a hundred and some odd ways to beat the Hollywood reader , this reality occurs because of the processes that go on within the act of working out a problem . Dramatica ( the first iteration of Narrative Science ) sees story this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having no boundaries and no limitations then by all means , write to your hearts content . Fly , be free . <p> Just do n't  expect the rest of us to remain engaged in your work . <p> Audiences expect stories to think like they do .

Woody finds it within himself to allow another toy the top spot and Buzz discovers he s not really the Space Ranger he thought he was . What about The Sixth Sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes , but does n't  little Cole change as well when he finally musters up the courage to visit the poisoned girl ? And what of Pride and Prejudice does n't  that classic beloved novel tell the story of two characters meeting in the middle ? <p> Perhaps Narrative Science misses the mark . Perhaps there are exceptions to this rule <p> not quite . <p> The problem lies in Dramaticas definition of change and what most people mean when they think of characters changing . <h> How Narrative Science Sees Character <p> Contrary to centuries of thought on story , Dramatica sees the two central characters of a story not as fully imagined three-dimensional people , but rather as a context for perspective . Remember the basic given about stories as analogies to problem-solving ? To fully comprehend and gain meaning from this act of problem-solving , all perspectives need to be addressed . One mans terrorist is another mans freedom-fighter ? That 's the kind of dissonance differing perspectives offer ; that 's how a story grants greater meaning to its events . <p> The Main Character gives the Audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we experience what it is like to actually deal with the problem personally , as if " I " have the problem . The Influence Character offers up an alternative to the Main Characters stance by showing how someone else deals with the problem . From there we experience what it is like for " You " to deal with the problem . <p> The Overall Story Throughline and the Relationship Story Throughline round out those perspectives by offering us a chance to see how " They " experience the problem and how " We " experience the problem , respectively . But for now , seeing the Main Character and Influence Character as perspectives rather than fully-realized people makes it easier to explain the reason for that first rule . <h> Giving Meaning through Problem-Solving <p> The Influence Character enters the picture and tension mounts .

Capitulation leads to resolution which in turn , leads to meaning . By showing whether or not the " winning " perspective leads to triumph or tragedy , the Author proves the appropriateness of using a certain perspective to solve problems . <p> The Author crafts greater meaning to a storys events . <p> Sometimes the Influence Character was right , the Main Character changes perspective and the story results in triumph ( Star Wars , The Kings Speech and Finding Nemo ) . Sometimes it was the Main Character who was right , the Influence Character justly surrenders and the story results in triumph ( Star Trek , In the Heat of the Night , and The Iron Giant ) . Sadly though there are times when being " right " was actually wrong . The Main Character " wins " with the Influence Character changing perspective , yet the result tumbles into tragedy ( Brokeback Mountain , Moulin Rouge ! and Reservoir Dogs ) . <h> But What About Meeting Halfway ? <p> If both principal characters change their perspectives , the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best ? How am I to solve my own problems in life ? What exactly was this story trying to say ? <p> Surely compromise solves problems . But in order to tell that story , one character would have to maintain an all-or-nothing perspective while the other would call for greater synergy . The former would eventually change and the story would end in triumph , proving that compromise solves problems . <p> When a story simply shows two characters coming together , both changing , that alternative perspective ceases to exist and a hole the size of Texas ( or perhaps Antarctica ) opens up within the storys argument . The Author fails to show the problem from all sides . Suddenly the Author leaves space for exceptions , giving opportunity for an Audience to dissent and eventually discount their work wholesale.1 <p> In other words , no one will go see the movie . <h> A Call for Greater Clarity <p> Rules of story structureat least the kind of " rules " found in Dramaticaexist to give purpose to the telling of a story .

Does n't  it make sense that someone should always win or lose in the end ? <h> The Matrix <p> The major problem of The Matrix surrounds a group of renegade humans struggling to find the One who can bring down their computerized slave masters . It begins with Morpheus choice of Mr. Thomas Andersen as the Chosen One and ends with Neos decision that he is , in fact , the One they have been looking for . <p> In contrast to Star Wars and Unforgiven which left the majority of the fighting and achieving for the second half , The Matrix starts out with the renegade humans fighting and sparring with the Agents in a race to reach Mr. Andersen first . The First Act concerns itself with the hunt itself ( Doing ) and turns when the cubicle jockey decides to come in off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost their Chosen One ( Obtaining ) and must now work even harder to free him from his virtual constraints . They succeed and Neo is freed from his digital bonds . <p> Now here it may seem like the Second Act should really be Learning . After all , Morpheus spends a great deal of time teaching Neo about the Matrix and what happened all those years ago . But this information is really directed towards Neo and as such , is more a part of his personal journey . When examining the problems in the story at large and the contexts with which to examine them , it becomes necessary to look at those events that affect everyone in the story , not just one person . Again , we are concentrating our attention on the larger picture . <p> Thus , when looking at the conflict between computers and humans , it is clear that much of this struggle to gather information comes during the second half of The Matrix . Beginning with Cyphers decision to betray his fellow humans , this Third Act finds both parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of Morpheus ( Learning ) . The Fourth Act wraps things up as both humans and computers come to realize Neos true potential for changing the Matrix ( Understanding ) . <h> The Sixth Sense <p> Before diving into this last example , it should be noted once again the difference between the personal storyline of the Main Character and the problems experienced by everyone in the story . Without giving away too much ( for those who have yet to see it ) , Malcoms personal issues are the thing that most audiences remember from the film . The following discussion , as was the case with the previous films , centers around the problems facing every character in the story . <p> The major problem in The Sixth Sense revolves around a deeply disturbed young boy and his claims that he can " see dead people . " The problems begin with another as-equally-disturbed young mans shooting of an innocent doctor and end with the reveals ( both in the little girls home and in the car with his mom ) that this little boy really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a much quieter film than the previous ones , the cast is smaller and the scenes less magnificent . Yet , the same four contexts are explored , in a very different order . <p> In the First Act , the therapist ( Malcom ) meets his new patient and tries his best to Learn as much about him as he can , even if that means chasing him halfway across town . Things turn when the boy reveals his tendency towards violent thoughts . The Second Act finds the therapist engaging the young boy in several different exercises , the results of which terrify the boys mother ( Doing ) . The Third Act finds the boys mother challenging him to deny stealing her mothers broach ( Obtaining ) . And finally in the Fourth Act , both therapist and boy travel to a funeral where they help a grieving father truly Understand the extent of his wifes sickness . <p> In both The Sixth Sense and The Matrix , the focus in the last Act is on everyone in the story coming to a greater Understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. " win " and Cole ends up triumphant at the school play , but both these events are n't  so much about achieving something as they are about a greater revelation of character . Again , the structural and dynamic choices made elsewhere within the story call for this to be the final Act . It simply makes sense that these films should end this way , and trying to flip the Act order around would only break their individual stories . <h> The Path Forward <p> The journey towards better storytelling comes with the recognition that Acts and the issues the characters face within them are a by-product of a story examining the different ways to solve its major problems . For each kind of problem , there are four contexts from which one can try to solve it , four different points of attack the human mind takes when it goes about solving an actual problem . <p> Note that both The Incredibles and Hamlet ( covered in the previous article on Plot Points and the Inciting Incident ) have been left out of this article . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much more sophisticated than your typical superhero fare is because it is not exploring the typical problems caused by Understanding , Doing , Learning and Obtaining . The problems within this Brad Bird spectacular are much more cerebral and more focused on the fallout that occurs when characters try to pretend to be something they are not . While the results of such thinking do require fighting as a response , the true source of everyones problems lie in a completely different area and would require an entirely new article to explain . Same with Hamlet . <p> For now , it is enough to simply understand the reason why there are four Acts in every complete story . Each act corresponds to a context the human mind explores in trying to solve a problem . Once those four acts have been travelled through , once all four contexts have been examined , the story is complete . Leave one out and the story will falter , add another one and it will feel like another story is going on . <p> There is no limit to the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are no set scenes , no familiar emotional beats a " Hero " must meet in order for a story to work . All that is required is an appreciation of the process that exists within a story , and a sincere desire to see to it that the mechanism works the way it was intended . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> The idea that every complete story is an analogy to the human mind trying to solve a problem is a concept that sits at the heart of the Dramatica theory of story . This concept , known as the Story Mind , is the basis for everything the theory attempts to explain . Not every film or work of fiction follows this model . But then again , not every film or work of fiction is worth remembering . Timelessness often requires that a story be based upon the minds own problem-solving process . <p> Campbell et . al . were , in effect , trying to describe this process without first recognizing this correlation between the human mind and a story . They were right in pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is some purpose to the story being told . It was their individual interpretations , however , that were inaccurate because of their failure to see the reason why Acts exist and how the order in which they appear determines the meaning of a story . <p> Exactly how these Acts progress requires the actual Dramatica software itself . Based upon the structural and dynamic choices an Author makes , the software will relay back the order in which each individual Act must occur . <p> How it does this is Dramaticas " secret sauce " and the reason why the software was developed in the first place . You can certainly do much without the program , but this one essential piecethe order in which Acts should appearcan certainly be made easier if you have access to the program . Pre-1994 writers had to rely on their instincts and countless drafts to get it right . 21st century writers can still do the same and , if their own egos are so wrapped up in their own accomplishments , then perhaps they should . <p> However , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of great stories rather than as altars of self-dom would find childlike amazement in the magic available to them today . Dramatica can be frighteningly prescient in the way it can predict your own " writers " instinct and insure that the story you create is both timeless and complete .

Because through this person , an audience experiences first-hand the emotions and consequences of the narrative surrounding them . <p> But there is another , less understood character that is primarily responsible for influencing growth in the Main Character . This character is known as the Influence Character . <p> When the Influence Character is steadfast , then he will make his arguments to the Main Character in reference to his own drive . He will treat his own drive as if the same things should be driving all others as well . <p> This part I knew and understood but it was what came after it that made me stop and think , " Why had n't  I seen that before ? " Ive been working on and off with Dramatica for over 10 years now and probably have read the following line a million times . But for some reason it never really resonated with me until last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Influence Character says to the Main Character , " you know , we are just like , you and I , " ( if the IC is steadfast ) or " we are nothing alike , " ( if the IC changes ) .

Is it really that easy ? <p> Overall , I understand that this is a generality and therefore shouldnt be taken as a strict rule of dramatic narrative , but it started me thinking . How did this generality hold up under further scrutiny ? And more importantly , could it help me with my own work ? <p> I took six Influence Characters , three who Change and three who Remain Steadfast , and applied the above axiom . <h> Change Influence Characters <p> Score one for Marshall Samuel Gerard in The Fugitive .

Robert wishes to join Wallace but his father reminds him that Robert is a noblemen , not some commoner like Wallace . " Uncompromising men are easy to admireBut it is exactly the ability to compromise that makes a man noble .

When Rickys boss threatens to fire him for not working , Ricky tells him , " Fine , do n't  pay me . I quit . Now leave me alone . " Words Lester wishes he could say to his own boss . Ricky does n't  come out and say " You and I are alike , " but he might as well have . <p> What about the obviously named Cole Sear ( Haley Joel Osment ) and his relationship with the troubled child psychologist Malcom Crowe ( Bruce Willis ) in The Sixth Sense ?

" We cut to Red , his head hung low . And although we cant read the expression on his face , we know for certain that Red feels the same . Personally I like it much better when you can do the " You and I are alike " line without actually having to say it - part of the reason why I chose these examples . <h> Conclusion <p> So does the rule work ? <p> It seems like it does .

But putting that story into action and telling it in a way that is compelling and engaging can be quite overwhelming . <p> That is where Narrative First and the Dramatica theory of story come in . Whether you want to tell the story of your walkabout through Europe , your quest to climb the tallest mountain in California , your nights and weekends developing the skills of your daughters soccer team , or your efforts to transform the culture of your business or organization you need to know and appreciate the various complexities of effective narrative . By using techniques proven time and time again to be successful towards the structuring of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into something truly captivatingand meaningful . <p> As mentioned several times here and elsewhere , life is meaningless until we put the events of our lives into context . Stories give meaning to our lives by putting everything in context . Fusing character , plot , theme , and genre into one cohesive " message " the mundane , chaotic , seemingly inconsequential moments of our lives become transformative . <p> The following is a sneak-peak at the step-by-step approach we use when helping writers craft their story , whether fiction or non-fiction . Feel free to start using it in developing your own projects , and we look forward to hearing your story soon . <h> The Basic Plot <p> The first four story points concern the story itself . What were you after and how it all turned out . Where the pressure came from and how you felt about the experience . Laying the groundwork for the narrative up front helps set the stage and starts to give form to the formless . <h> Step One : The Story Goal <p> The first and possibly the easiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . The Story Goal helps set the context for what you will be looking at and gives a starting and ending point for the narrative . Did you want to learn everything you could about Eastern culture ? Maybe you had a half-marathon you wanted to compete in . Maybe you wanted to win the half-marathon.1 Or maybe you wanted to help your business embody Old World principles of respect and honor . Regardless the type of Goal , there was some endgame you had in mindsomething you set out to accomplish . Write about that Goal . <h> Step Two : The Story Limit <p> Not that you have set the context for your story , begin to take a look at the scope of your narrative . Every great story comes to an end because the characters run out of time , or run out of options . Since you are the character in this story , which one sounds most appropriate in this context ? Did you set out on a walkabout through five Eastern European countries ? If so , then your story came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you worked your way through those five countries until finally you reached the last one . You likely felt as if time was running out when you hit that last country , but that is what it is like to be in a story . <p> With Dramatica and these Story Points , you want to step outside of yourself and your own experience and see story as this thingthis entity that you are sculpting . It can be difficult at times , especially since the fun part of writing is pretending you are the characters and living vicariously through them . The only problem with that approach is you will never be able to see the forest for the trees . You might find meaning , but you will never be able to predict how your story should work to give that meaning . <p> The Story Limit looks one way to the Author , but a completely different way to the characters within the story . As you are crafting a story , you need to be able to see outside of your own experience and see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walkabout through Europe , it may have felt at the time as if you were running out of time , but putting that kind of time limit on a narrative would not grant the same feeling to your readers . Only a limit crafted from a number of options gives that time running out feeling . <p> Perhaps your story did not find itself limited by options , but rather by time . Maybe you were preparing for a marathon that took place 57 days from when you started . You probably pulled out a calendar and circled that date . Each morning you woke up , checked off a day , and set about training for the end . As that day rapidly approached , you probably felt panicked as if you were running out of things you could dooptions you could take . Again , different experience depending on your point-of-view as Author or character . <p> Whether writing a story about options running out or time running out , take some time now to weave that Story Limit into your paragraph about the Story Goal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Goal sets a finish line , the Limit sets the scope and adds pressure towards that Goal . In fact , all of these Story Points work together to tell the holistic " message " of your story . In essence , you sculpt your story by adding to it , rather than shaving away the bits you do n't  need . With each of these steps , build upon the last to create a lasting and transformative narrative . <h> Step Three : The Story Outcome <p> This one is easy . Did you win or lose ? <p> Did you land that account or climb that mountain ? Did your sales team embody those principles of success or did they tear themselves apart ? Did you fail to make the quarterfinals in that screenplay contest ? Or did you find out that you can never truly know all there is to know about a culture ? <p> Whatever the Story Outcome , write a new paragraph about what happened at the end of your story . Silly and simple , yesbut essential towards communicating the eventual message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story Goal . The Story Limit brought pressure down on your efforts . And finally , once that last limit ran out you either achieved success or you failed miserably . <p> And not personal success or personal failure . It is likely you set out to accomplish one thing , but learned something else was far more important . That is a great story and one many want to communicate . But the " far more important " angle is found in another Story Points , not this one . What you want to do with the Story Outcome is focus on whether or not the Goal was reached . How you felt about that outcome is the subject of our next Story Point . <h> Step Four : The Story Judgment <p> In a separate paragraph at the end , write about how you felt about your entire experience . Was it worth it visiting all those countries ? Did you find relief after finishing the marathon ? Or did you feel worse about even participating ? Did you end up even more lost and confused at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out foris a cold and logical Story Point , devoid of emotion or any real passion . The same can be said of the Story Limit and the Story Outcome . But here at the end , clueing us in on how you felt about the story gives us the Audience a reason to care . It helps us empathize with your plight and understand everything you went through . <p> Our minds crave emotional logic every bit as much as they chew on rational logic . A story needs both sides lest it risk having " holes " in the logic . Failing to give an Audience an emotional assessment of a narrative is akin to reading the stock section of the Wall Street Journal . Unless you tell us how you feel about how things are changing , we see only numbers . <p> As you can see with this last Story Pointthe Story Judgmentwe are starting to work our way towards the more personal side of things . We start with the rational side of things because it can often be easier , particularly if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the intimate details . They want to know who you are , where you came from , and what issues you had to overcome . <h> Opening Up <p> Having established a framework for your story and a context for the events , we now turn our attention towards you . This is often the most difficult part of turning anyones life into a story because it can be hard to sit back and take an objective look at yourself . We need to identify the personal issues in your life as they are the key to giving your story emotional resonance . <p> Your readers or viewers want a reason to care . They want to know something intimate about you that they can somehow relate to their own lifes struggle . If you stay closed off and refuse to open up and be honest about what you went through , the story itself will feel closed and muted . No one wants to sit through a story like that . <p> If these events just occurred , the emotional fallout may still be so overwhelming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is you were coming from . The more time you have between the end of what happened and the time when you begin the story can make all the difference in understanding your own issues . <h> The Characters <p> For a story to connect , an emotional attachment needs to be made between Author and Audience . Successful Authors do this by giving the central character of their story deep personal issuesissues that may be familiar or recognizable to an Audience . The more honest and true these issues are , the greater the connection . <h> Step Five : Your Own Personal Baggage <p> In a separate paragraph at the beginning of your story , write about your own personal baggage and those issues you brought to this narrative . What made it more difficult for you to reach the Story Goal and what prevented you from seeing the endgame ? In the middle of your story , write about how you worked through that baggage , and then at the end let us know what happened to it all . <p> In Dramatica , this personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the Main Character in this story , so develop and write about your issues . <p> here 's a clue : the Story Judgment from Step Four answers the question about what happened to your personal baggage . Remember how every Story Point relates to one another ? If you felt relief at the end of your story then you can probably trace that back to you overcoming your issues . If instead you felt lost and confused , you probably still had more to work through . <p> There is a chance these two steps may find themselves in conflict . If so , you will want to adjust your narrative to bring them into alignment . Perhaps the discord or dissonance can be examined in another story . To keep the structure of the narrative intact , you want to make sure that the deep personal issues you explore and your emotional assessment at the end of the piece cover the same ground . To deviate would only bring confusion to your Audience . <h> Step Six : Your Unique Point-of-View <p> Those issues likely instilled within you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle to reach the Goal , or what is more often the caseheld you back . Be honest about your experience and start to examine those paradigms that came into play during this story . This step requires deep introspection and truth for it to be successful . <p> In the paragraph where you first explored your personal baggage , begin to write about that unique point-of-view . Did it lead you to even greater danger in Iraq and Tel Aviv ? Did it give you the strength to take that extra step up the mountain ? Or did it make it almost impossible for you to communicate to your team members the importance of building relationships ? Regardless , integrate that unique perspective into your narrative . <p> We all hold personal perspectives that determine how we approach the setbacks in our lives and how we intend to resolve them . Whether or not we maintain this point-of-view is contained in the Main Character Resolvea Story Point that defines adherence to this paradigm till the bitter end , or a deviation to anothers point-of-view . That other is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate only on establishing your unique perspective . <p> We think we are on the right path , but that is because we do n't  know any better . Our baggage is our baggage , our thoughts a byproduct of that baggage . But we are not our thoughts . And we are capable of changing those perspectives if the right catalyst comes along . <h> Step Seven : Anothers Unique Point-of-View <p> Think back to your experience within this story . Growth does not happen in a vacuum . You likely encountered several challenges along the way , both personal and interpersonal . Was there someone who motivated you emotionally to take this journey ? It may be difficult to identify at first , but think . <p> Who was the greatest personal influence on you during this time ? Who challenged you deal with that personal baggage ? You want to make sure whoever it is , that their unique perspective ties in directly with you overcoming or succumbing to that baggage . <p> It may have been a father figure , or your actual father . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a teacher . It could have been your neighbor or it could have been your dog . There may have been someone on your sales team whowhile similar to you in many respectswas different enough to rub you the wrong way . <p> You want that rub . <p> Key to integrating this character into your story is contrasting your unique perspective with theirs . What was it about them that challenged you to see the world a different way ? Were you even conscious that that was going on at the time ? <p> Perhaps you went on this journey because you did n't  see the world the way your father did . Perhaps his unique perspective haunted you every step of the wayeven if he was n't there . Or maybe your wife never thought you would ever climb that mountainmaybe family was more important to her . Or maybe your boss sees the world from more of a transactional point-of-view . The sale makes the relationship . <p> Whatever the source of contrasting point-of-view , write it into your story . This is the Influence Character Throughline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how it helps to develop and nudge the way you see things . Those competing perspectives eventually come to a head once the Story Limit falls away and the Goal is there , ready for the taking . <h> Step Eight : Who Won ? <p> In Step Five you identified your personal baggage . In Step Six you explored your unique point-of-view that grew from that personal baggage and made it difficult at times for you to continue your journey . And in Step Seven you identified that alternative way of seeing things that challenged your world paradigm and forced you to face your own personal issues . Now , you want to let us know <p> which one of you adopted the others point-of-view ? <p> That is how you transform life events into a story . <p> When looking at the Main Character and Influence Character of your story , one of them will Change their paradigm to match the others point-of-view , and one of them will hold strong and remain Steadfast in their convictions . This is an important rule of narrative and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of you adopted the others point-of-view or saw things the same way in the end . And while that is beautiful , that really is n't the way things turned out . There likely was another third perspective at play , one that eschewed collaboration for competition , that was the true unique alternative perspective to your own . If this is the case , you will want to revisit Step Seven and adjust . <p> You want to figure out who came over to the others side and how that adoption or transformation of perspective resulted in the Story Outcome . Yep , were going all the way back to Step Three . Integrate this change in point-of-view with that outcome and show how the final agreed upon approach manifested that ending . <p> Did your father finally see things your way ? Or did you finally realize that the old man had it right ? Did you give up climbing the mountain because you agreed with your wife regarding family first ? Or did she strap on those boots and beat you to the top ? How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a transaction sales-oriented mindset and the business closed within days ? Or did you manage to transform everyone in the officeincluding your bossto think more in terms of relationships and did you have your first blockbuster quarter ? <p> Writing a story this way infuses your narrative with meaning . No longer is it simply a rehashing of events , but rather a sophisticated means of communicating something deep and important . As mentioned in our article Transforming Real Life into a Story : <p> A functional narrative gives meaning to made-up imaginary events . A functional real-world narrative must also give meaningbut to events that have no inherent meaning . <p> By arguing that a certain approach leads to a certain outcome , you prove to your Audience that the events of your life had purpose . They had a reason for being . <h> Step Nine : The Relationship <p> Finallyand this is simply a teaserwrite about the relationship that exists between you and that person or group of people that held an alternative perspective to your own . If it was your father , write about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wife , write about your marriage and whether the events of the story brought you closer together or drove you further apart . If it was your boss , do n't  think of the relationship between boss and employeeyou already have that covered with the basic plot and the rest of the story . Instead , think of the actual relationship between you two . Were you once friends and now you 're not ? Was she always a mentor to you ? Think of that personal heartfelt Relationship Story Throughline between two people and carry that into your story . <p> The key to doing that effectively and confidently require further study and a greater understanding of the dynamics at play between relationships and basic plot .

Whether it be through the high-school hijinks of Election or the central coast coziness of Sideways , the celebrated filmmaker delivers complete stories . Nebraska extends his trend by disguising a grand argument beneath stark landscapes and authentic characters . <p> The Overall Story Throughline begins when Sad-sack stereo salesman David Grant ( Will Forte ) agrees to take his father Woody ( Bruce Dern ) to Lincoln , Nebraska . The reason ? To collect a $1 million sweepstakes prize Woody believes he has won . As they travel from Billings , Montana the two run into friends and familydevious and deliriouswho have their own agendas when it comes to Woodys money . <p> David has issues of his own .

If there is any criticism to be had with this film it could rest firmly with Davids story . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the throughline itself becomes lost along the way . This dialing back of personal issues creates a sense of detachment within the Audience , preventing honest involvement with the on-screen events ( Fortes uncomfortable performance only adds to this ) . <p> But this clearly is Woodys show . His acerbic and pained Influence Character Throughline resonates strongly with those familiar with acerbic and pained fathers ( and probably accounts for the films acceptability given its rather lackluster Main Character ) . As David learns more about where Woody came from and why he did the things he did , the two grow closer in ways they never thought possible . Their Relationship Story Throughline captures the true heart of this story , resolving with touching sincerity . <p> Audiences and critics alike praise Nebraska because they recognize the talents of a good storyteller . Effortlessly combining four throughlines into a single piece of narrative fiction , Alexander Payne elevates what could have been simple entertainment into a true work of art . 209542 @qwx1069542 <p> Story Engine Settings for Nebraska : 209540 @qwx1069540 
@@119272825 @8272825/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Predicting Who Will Listen To Your Story <h> Slight adjustments to the structure of your story can guarantee a larger audience . <p> Writing a story is one thing , finding an Audience to sit still and embrace your story is quite another . Many understand now that a functional narrative functions because it models the minds problem-solving process ; and many understand that men and women solve problems differently . Appreciating that difference makes it possible for writers to predict who will be drawn into their story , and who will simply be observers . <p> You will find two storyforms that are exactly the same in every single way except for one appreciationthe Story Limit . Whether you choose to limit this narrative by options or by time , the Main Character thematics , the Overall Story thematics , the Signposts in each and every Throughline , and even the Additional Plot Appreciations like the Goal and Consequenceall of those will be exactly the same . <p> Why is that ? <p> In fact , the longer you play around with Dramatica and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice a pattern : the Story Limit really does n't  do much of anything . Other story points seem to be connected together . You choose one and instantly Dramatica makes selections for other story points you have n't even addressed yet . <h> Connecting Story Points Together <p> Choose a Main Character Approach of Be-er , like our example above , and you will notice that it limits your choices for the Main Character Domain to either Manipulation or Fixed Attitude . This is because a Main Character believes they will find a solution to their problem in the same area they find their problem . If your Main Character has a weight problem , theyll try to address that problem first by eating less or working out more . If your Main Character has an issue with depression , they will first try to will themselves out of that depression by trying to be happy . <p> Whether or not those solutions work matters littlethats where the Main Character begins to regain some control over their life and why Authors will find it a fitting choice for their Main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Choose Steadfast for your Main Character Resolve and suddenly the Main Character and Overall Story can not share the same Problem and Solution in their Throughlines . Switch it to Changed and now they have to have the same Problem and Solution . Choose an Overall Story Concern of Understanding and Dramatica will force you to have a Story Consequence of Developing a Plan . Choose an Overall Story Goal of Changing Ones Nature and Dramatica will force you to have a Relationship Story Concern of Obtaining . <p> At first these selections may seem arbitrarybut only until you actually take the time to think them through . In Steadfast stories it is the work that is deemed most important in the narrative and therefore the Problem and Solution between the Main and Overall Stories need not be the same . In a Changed story the opposite is true : the dilemma is factored in here and Problem and Solution are everything . The Actual or Apparent Nature of a story determines its deep underlying thematics . <p> Same with the Concerns and Consequences . The consequence of failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to fill that hole in your understanding with your own concept of how things fit together . If everyone in the story is going to be struggling with changing their natures and becoming something they have never been before , then the counter to thatthe Relationship Story between the two principal charactersneeds to explore the efforts to achieve something ( or Obtain something ) in order to properly balance out the narrative . <p> That still leaves out the Story Limit . Why does n't  it affect anything ? <h> Hidden Features of Dramatica <p> The structural model of Dramatica that many are familiar with displays a model of the mind at rest . Here , everything sits comfortably in their correct position , perfectly balanced and at peace . <p> When an Author begins to make choices within Dramatica , choices like the Main Character Resolve , the Main Characters Approach , or the Story Outcome , the engine within Dramatica begins to twist and turn the above into a justified version of the model . Like a Rubiks cube with rubber bands wrapped around it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential leading up to the beginning of a story . Once set , the initial Story Driver comes along and begins to release that tension , unraveling the narrative until it can return to the model at rest once again . <p> The dynamic story points serve different functions in the winding up process . The Resolve determines which ThroughlineMain or Overall Storyis wound up first . The Approach determines whether the Main Character Throughline is in a positive or negative position ( upper or lower ) and the Growth determines whether that same Throughline is in a Companion or Dependent relationship with the Overall Story Throughline . <p> The Story Limit , it turns out , determines whether or not the children beneath each quad are carried over with the parent as it moves into position . The result of this is that the Author can actually determine exactly what element should be discussed in every single scene and in what order . <p> That is an incredible and highly informative tool for any writer <p> except that its complete overkill and detrimental to the creative process . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first version of Dramatica and decided to leave this feature out of the initial rollout . The Limits absence continues to this day as it seems that , after twenty years , writers and producers everywhere continue to struggle with the concept of mastering only four general Signposts , or Acts , per Throughline . The Plot Sequence Report , which bridges the gap between the current offerings and the insight afforded by the Limit , only confuses and confounds those who try to master it . Going deeper would result in hearsay from the uninformed . <p> But there is one , very important function the Story Limit does have that has nothing to do with the actual structure of the narrative . And it has everything to do with the Audience you are trying to reach . <h> Determining Who Will Listen to Your Story <p> While most of Dramatica deals with appreciations tied to the narrative structure of the story , there are four Audience Appreciations that predict how an Audience will react to a given narrative . The Audience Appreciation that consists of the Story Limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audience Reach . <p> Audience Reach identifies which parts of your audience are likely to empathize with your Main Character . More empathy equals greater attendance equals greater word-of-mouth equals greater revenue . By combining the choices made for the Story Limit and the Main Characters Problem-Solving Style , a schematic can be graphed to predict the kind of Audience the story will attract . <p> Linear + Optionlock == Everyone <p> Linear + Timelock == Mostly Male Audience members <p> Holistic + Optionlock == Mostly Female Audience members <p> Holistic + Timelock == No one <p> Problem-Solving Style is on the left , the Story Limit is on the right . In addition to having a discernible first Approach to problems , Main Characters employ a method of problem-solving that resorts to either Linear thinking or Holistic thinking . Typically , these lines of thinking fall along the gender line : Males think linearly , Females think holistically . Of course , there are variations and permutations in everything and this is not to say that one can not think using the others problem-solving style . It simply makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Main Character when they know his or her method of thinking . <p> The message is clear : if you want the largest audience , make sure your Main Character approaches problems linearly and that the story at large is brought to a climax by running out of options . If you want the smallest audience , give your Main Character a holistic approach to problem-solving while placing them under the restrains of a deadline . <p> Feels weird to even think about , right ? <p> That 's because it is relating a story about a character who has no concept of the pressure supposedly building up around them . They would be completely disaffected and disinterested . And so would the Audience . Holistic thinkers do n't  see time the way linear thinkers dothey do n't  see it as something that can not be malleable and transmuted into something else . <p> The two middle permutations of the Audience Reach account for the blind spots seen within both Male and Female Audience members . <h> The Male Audience Members Blind Spot <p> Guys cant stand people who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holistic thinkers , as it seems completely nutso to approach a problem by balancing the environment . This is why your guys guy friends despise watching Moulin Rouge ! . Christian ( Ewan McGregor ) is about to be revealed as trying to win over Satine ( Nicole Kidman ) in front of the Duke , and instead of punching and kicking his way to victory , the kid starts singing . <p> What ? ! <p> That 's the response from a linear thinking and one who has no concept of what can be accomplisted simply by a shift in the balance of things . Singing is the perfect solution in this narrative as it resets the tone of the Dukes anger and challenges the lecherous man to see Christian in a new light . In short , holistic thinking is right 50% of the time ; linear thinking is appropriate the other 50% . <p> But do n't  tell a linear-thinking Male Audience member that . Hell likely punch you in the face . <h> The Female Audience Members Blind Spot <p> For women , the Story Limit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they usually dotheyre very comfortable with the idea of dwindling options and choosing which option is the best . But when it comes to a Timelock , they have n't a clue . <p> When you use time as your basis for understanding everythingwhen you see the changes and acceleration and deceleration of forces around you first before the actual things themselvesof course time is n't going to seem a factor . A minute can seem like a year , a year like a minute . If you were forced to sit in a cave for nine months while you waited for an alien creature to leave your body , you would want someway to make the days seem like seconds , would n't you ? ! <p> Over time this became an important , yet often overlooked and under-appreciated way of seeing the world . Turning towards the 21st century , a renewed interest in the feminine and a greater holistic understanding of the world is under way . Just do n't  try to make them sit through High Noon , 3:10 to Yuma , or Armageddon.1 They will likely despise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyance with you . <h> Dramaticas Ability to Predict the Future <p> Last week , we discussed Dramaticas ability to predict the future of cable TV and ESPNs eventual internal conflict in the article Using Dramatica to Assess Narrative in the Real World . There it was revealed how Dramatica accurately predicted the eventual state of things today based on the dramatic potential put into place two years ago . The findings were all theoreticaluntil they werent . <p> Similarily , this notion of the Audience Reach being able to predict the potential audience for a narrative was conjecture . It was n't based on research or analysis . It was developed based on an understanding of human psychology and the difference between the way men and women process inequities and solve problems . And it would continue to be theoretical , if it werent for 22 years of ensuing analysis that proved it all correct . <p> If you go to the Dramatica site and look for the Analysis Filter , you will be presented with a collection of tools to help you better understand the presence of these story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication , Dramatica.com contains 320 different unique analyses of films , plays and novels . By setting the different story points with the drop-down menus provided , you can effectively search through those hundreds of stories for storyforms that fit your choices . <p> Out of 320 potential narratives , 210 of them feature Linear thinking Main Characters pressured by a dwindling number of options . That combination accounts for two-thirds of every story analyzed . <p> That is simply astounding . <p> Chris and Melanie were able to predict the kinds of narratives we would find in our culture based on the psychology of the central character and the plot device put into place to bring pressure on that character . <p> Amazing . <p> Switch to Holistic/Optionlock and click Refine . A little over 83 different films , novels and plays that satisfy the " chick flick " notion of a Holistic Main Character beset by an Optionlock . <p> Now let 's try the Mans man categoryLinear/Timelock . Just short of a dozenthat first one there is actually a random storyform we created in one of our Dramatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the majority of audiences are n't  really into them . <p> 2/3 of all stories feature Linear Main Characters pressured by a limited number of options . The other 1/3 feature Holistic Main Characters pressured by options and Linear Main Characters pressured by time . <p> But were still missing one last category : the Holistic/Timelock story . Set those in the Dramatica filter and press Refine and be prepared to be astounded by a prediction made over two decades ago . <p> Out of 320 stories , only four fit the bill of a Holistic Main Character trapped within a Timelock . <p> That 's right . <p> Only 1% of all stories turn out to be Holistic/Timelock stories . One of those , My Fair Lady , effectively ends about halfway in . Another , The American President actually has both Timelock and Optionlock in it . And the other , Donnie Darko , no one gets at all . <p> Though theoretical in presentation , Dramaticas ability to predict the behavior of writers and producers past , present , and future has no equal . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips predicted that a majority of complete and effective narratives would feature a Linear problem-solver caught within a story limited by a dwindling number of options . They went on further to predict a pathetic amount of stories featuring Holistic problem-solvers trapped by time . <p> The ensuing two decades of analysis proved their postulation correct and reaffirmed the power of Dramatica to accurately and confidently predict the soundness of a narrative . <p> Countless hours of sweat and turmoil go into the creation of a story . Whether it be projected on a screen , presented on stage , or devoured curled up on a couch , the presence of an effective and sound narrative is all that guarantees a fondness and admiration for the work put into it . <p> Great narrative can be predicted .

@@119272826 @8272826/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Understanding the Personal Goal of Your Main Character <h> The Dramatica theory of story makes it easy for Authors to determine what is of utmost concern to their Main Characters--if you understand what Dramatica is asking . <p> Beyond their concerns in the larger Overall Story of a narrative , every Main Character finds themselves focused on a concern personal and intimate to themselves . With so much attention focused on this area , this concern often comes across to the Audience as a goal for the Main Character . Whether conscious of it from the beginning or something they synthesize towards the end , the Main Character exists in the narrative to achieve that concern . <p> Unfortunately , writing with Dramatica is confusing at times . The application will ask you if your Overall Story Throughline is in a Situation or an Activity and your only answer is yes ! And then it will ask you if your story is driven by Actions or Decisions and all of a sudden you cant decide if your character is acting a certain way or if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go from the application to the discussion boards to here and back to the application and then back and forth over and over in your own mind . <p> And therein lies the problem . <p> We are context-shifting machines . That 's how we survive . If we cant problem-solve a nuisance we justify it away , hiding it from ourselves so we can move on with our lives . If we cant solve a problem from one perspective we will take another . It is a strength in our day-to-day lives , but a liability when it comes to writing . <p> Shifting context on the reader without altering the structure of a narrative only confuses and confounds them . If you are going to make an argument , then please do so concretely is all an Audience asks of an Author . Keep your story consistent and they sit riveted through the whole thing . <p> That is all Dramatica is asking of you when it asks these questions . The application is asking you to set the context for a particular story point so it knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you into your own decisions , Dramatica acts as a virtual writing partner that keeps you honest to your own storytelling . <p> You cant choose between Situation or Activity because you can easily make that shift in your own head . Both answers seem right . You cant decide between Decisions or Actions because to you a decision looks like an action that looks like a decision . Turns out our minds are not great tools for keeping the structure of a story consistent . Dramatica is . <p> Thankfully there are ways to trick your mind into coming up with consistent and confident answers to these questions . <h> Litmus Test for Domains <p> If you are having trouble making the decision whether or not a Throughline falls into a Situation or Activity , simply ask yourself : <p> If the situation they were stuck in suddenly became unstuck , would there still be a problem ? <p> If the answer is NO , then the Domain might be in a Situation . We say might because it is always good to have a handful of examples to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good possibility that we are on the right track , but it is always nice to have more proof . If the answer is YES , then the Domain is definitely not in a Situation . <p> Likewise you can ask : <p> If they stopped doing the activities they were doing , would there still be a problem ? <p> If the answer is NO , then the Domain might be in Activity . If the answer is YES , then the Domain is definitely not in Activity . <p> The trick hereas with all these litmus testsis to rule out all the things are not sources of conflict to help you focus on what is creating the conflict . <p> Take for instance Braveheart . England moves in and starts sleeping with the wives of the Sons of Scotland on the night of their betrothal . Dirty bastards ! If you were sitting down with Dramatica to write that story , the application would ask if the Overall Story Throughline of that story fell in a Situation or an Activity . <p> At first you might think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be the biggest problem . But if those rascals stopped doing what they were doing , would there still be a problem ? Certainly . England is all up in Scotlands business , causing all kinds of problems for themnot simply sleeping with their women . It is the English presence within their country that riles the Scots up and motivate the conflict . So what if England were to leave Scotland , would there still be a problem ? <p> No . <p> That is how you can confidently determine that the Overall Story Throughline for Braveheart is in Situation . If you remove something from the story and there is still a problem , then it was never a problem to begin with . <h> Litmus Test for Story Driver <p> For the Story Driverthat element of story that determines what the major plot points of a narrative arethe test is similar : <p> If X had n't  happened , is it likely that Y would have occurred ? <p> With X being an Action or Decision and Y being the other side of the coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an Action ) . <p> If the answer is NO , then X might be a Story Driver . If the answer is YES , then X is definitely not a Story Driver . <p> Here we are looking less for the source of conflict within a Throughline and more for the cause behind the effects . The principle of negation of instance remains the same . If you can remove it and the story still thrums along , you do n't  have a driver . <p> Story points are essential elements to the life force that propels a narrative forward . If an element of story can be removed without a significant impact on the meaning of a story ( like backstory ) then it is non-essential and deficient for the purposes of forming a story . <p> As mentioned in the blogpost of our analysis of Kramer vs . Kramer , this test of the Concern is a true revelation . It also implies that this kind of test works throughout the entire Dramatica model . Take any story point you are confused or walking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are bound to easily see the correct answer . <p> If you listen to our analysis of Kramer vs . Kramer or watch the video on YouTube , you will hear us discuss a story point known as the Concern . The reason we ask this question in Dramatica is that it helps us narrow down the possible storyforms . In every completely story , the Main Character will have one general Concern that shows up throughout the entire narrative . This Concern acts as a sort of Goal for their Personal Throughline and helps pinpoint the location of conflict within their storyline . <p> In the analysis I argue for Teds Main Character Concern to be in How Things are Changing over the Future . In my estimation , Ted was more concerned with losing his wife and his job and how everything was shifting more than he was concerned about how things would be for him down the road . Part of this appraisal stems from my personal preference for stories beyond the " normal " , but a good portion of it comes from plain misunderstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire a shift in my own thinking . <p> At one point Chris mentions that Ted needs to " let that Concern of the Future go " before he can grow.1 Whether Chris was speaking in regards to the Main Character Growth or about the Concern in general , his words struck me as concrete reasoning for why I was wrong . <p> If How Things Are Changing were a legitimate Concern for Ted as I had said , that would mean things will continue to be a problem for Ted until he let 's that Concern of How Things are Changing go . This is clearly not true for him . In fact , Ted basically embraces the changing nature of things and lives within that moment there at the end of the story . Progress could still be somewhat of a Concern for him . <p> What he is not concerned with anymore is the Future . <p> And that is the new litmus test for Concerns : <p> If you remove the structural item as a point of Concern for the Throughline , would the Throughline still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that structural item might be the their Concern . If yes , then it definitely is NOT the Concern . <p> With that in mind , it was clear enough for me to see that Teds true Concern was the Future . The source of trouble in his personal Throughline and the area where he would ultimately find resolution by letting that trouble go lie firmly in what will be .

What if he let go of his concern of how things were changing for himhow he was n't moving up the ladder quickly enough and facing the kind of opponents he needed to face to be the best ? Now that sounds like How Things are Changing might be his concern . If Johsnon let all those worries go , he would n't have had so many problems . Let go of the past about his dad , or his future , or how things were now and he still would have that chip on his shoulder . His past really weighs him down , but letting it go would not have resolved his issues .

Our ability to shift contexts and see things from multiple angles at once clouds our attempts to define story points that eventually need to be defined . <p> After 20 years , it sure is nice to be surprised by some new revelation in regards to the Dramatica theory of story . I hope thatin sharing this discoveryyou find an easy way to quickly and confidently determine the individual story points for your own narrative .

Writers act like other writers . They safeguard themselves from the pain of unraveling what they know about story by hiding behind Aristotle , claims of artistic integrity , or the stifling weight of an outline . Their most consistent mistake rests in the assumption that the main plot of a story ( or " A " story line ) is simply the framework that all the really important stuff hangs from ; that character and relationships reign supreme . <p> Its all important stuff . <p> True , some writers emphasize character over the machinations of the story world at large , but in the end both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sense of what has happened . <h> The Interlocking of Character and Plot <p> Character can not claim prominence over plot as both exist simultaneously within a piece of narrative , regardless of Authors intent . Character represents a subjective context on the matters at hand , while plot portrays an objective context . One cant simply cast the other unimportant because they find it unnecessary any more than they can disavow general relativity because stars are pretty . A subjective context presupposes an objective one . <p> The Dramatica theory of story exposes the difference between the objective view and subjective with its concept of the four throughlines . The Main Character Throughline and the Relationship Story Throughline manage the subjective view of the narrative while the Overall Story Throughline and the Influence Character Throughline handle the objective . Writers who write from the heart often leave out these last two . They may pay lip service to an Overall Story Throughline by casting the Main Character into the role of Protagonist and claiming the events " his " story , but by doing so fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Many writers consider this larger perspective to be " unnecessary " or just the " MacGuffin " or mechanical " or " too limiting " to their work . Writing this perspective offers little in terms of emotional expressionism .

Writers such as these wish to express their fanciful associations to the text . <p> That 's the fun stuff . <p> Objective , overallthese are not the words of a writer who wears his heart on his sleeve or one who wears his heart on the page .

If that person fails , then the story ends with inequity . <p> That person is the Protagonist of the story . <p> The concept of the Protagonist exists as a shorthand term to describe the character pushing for this resolution . The Antagonist operates as a shorthand term for character(s) preventing this resolution . One works for the Goal and successful resolution . One works against the Goal and would prefer the Consequences instead . Stories without these two forces lack narrative drive . <h> The Slice of Life Cop-Out <p> Stories that fail to provide these two alternative views can not claim to be stories . Whether a slice-of-life tone poem ( The Tree of Life ) or a simple tale designed to satiate the senses ( any Transformers movie ) , narrative that offers one offers offers only a part .

If a story only provides one side of the story , the mind rebels , walks out muttering something about " story holes " or " false characters " or simply " a bad story . " Audiences expect some greater context to appreciate the relationships between the characters . <h> The Great Models of Narrative <p> All great narratives work this way . The external conflict generated by the inequity of the story reflects itself in the juxtaposition between the smaller inter-personal relationship between two characters and the larger objectified relationships between all the characters . <p> In Pride and Prejudice you have Elizabeth and Darcy and their romantic relationship set against the social challenges of 19th century Englands upper class values tow marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wickhams , the Collins , the Bingleys , and , of course , the Bennets more than simply backdrop for romance .

The interpersonal relationship between the two takes center stage , but Shakespeare also manages to weave in the war between the Capulets and the Montagues . Misplaced expectations and a rush to resolve intolerable circumstances describe the personal as well as the extra-personal .

With separation comes the awareness of an inequity , and a desire to return back to a state of parity . Every problem has a solution , and a story explores that process of trying to attain resolution . <p> Clearly , the murder of Bruces parents created a separation within Bruce personally . But it also did so within the context of the Overall Story Throughlinethat Throughline that defines the source of conflict for all . As Ras al Ghul explains : <p> With Gotham , we tried a new one : Economics . But we underestimated certain of Gothams citizens such as your parents . Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths galvanized the city into saving itself and Gotham has limped on ever since . <p> That Action Story Driver started not only Bruces Throughline , but the Overall Story Throughline of driving Gotham into chaos . This is why the Dramatica storyform for Batman Begins uses Chaos to define the Overall Story Throughline . With the city " galvanized " to save itself , a separation began between what Gotham wanted and what the League of Shadows saw fit . Chaos was the problem that arose because of that separation . <p> And only Order can resolve Chaos . <h> The Meaningful Character Arc <p> One of the story points Dramatica defines is the Main Character Approach . Some Main Characters will prefer to solve problems externally and are known a Do-er , while others prefer to solve problems internally as a Be-er . As explained in Writers Who Write the Same Main Character , Bruce is a Be-er : <p> At first , this may seem counterintuitive . Certainly Bruce spends the bulk of the film doing things . When we first meet him he takes on seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engages in ninja school and spends pretty much the entire second half of the film fighting his way to victory . But when you look at the personal moments with Wayne , those moments that are intimate to his character and his character onlyyou can begin to see a preference for a different kind of approach . <p> The first half of the narrative Bruce spends as a Be-er . The second half of the narrative as a Do-er . Nolan weaves from present to past to present again , showing scenes of Bruce solving problems externally followed by scenes of internal problem solving . This is why it can seem as if Bruce is a Do-er at times . But what we are really seeing is the second half of Bruces emotional arc <p> That switch from Be-er to Do-er is encoded within another story point , the Main Character LONG ... A character who Changes their Resolve will move from one approach to the other . A Do-er changes to a Be-er , a Be-er changes to a Do-er . Bruce points this out in no uncertain terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important thing , but it is present in all effective narrative . <p> In The Dark Knight the order is reversed . In the 2nd film , Bruce changes from his heroic ways as a Do-er to Be-ing the villain Gotham deserves . Same dynamic , different order . <p> This approach to solving problems changes because the Main Character is adopting the Influence Charcaters point-of-view . Ras is a Do-er through and through . Bruce finally doing what is necessary resolves the argument between them as it completes his emotional arc from Be-er to Do-er . <p> As a Be-er , Bruce is lost . Aimless . Falling in with the criminal element and wrecking havoc on those who would do harm by becoming a symbol . That Main Character Problem of Chaos only magnifies the struggle to overcome the memory of his parents death . The bats swirling around him a perfect visualization of the chaos going on in his head . <p> It is only once he brings Order to his own thoughts is he able to finally bring Order to Gotham and save the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can remove a scene and it wo n't have any noticeable effect on the meaning of a storyon what you are trying to communicatethen it is backstory and not necessary . If those scenes carry unique identifiers as to the structure of a narrative then they are not backstory and must be included to complete the message of the story . <p> Batman Begins works as a perfect example of telling backstory that is n't backstory . Chronological time-shifting and other techniques of storyweaving bring interest to a story while maintaining the integrity of the narrative . Discovering the storyform of your particular story and understanding how those story points work together can help you determine what is essential for your story and what is not .

Whether because its easier to sell a known property with a built-in audience , or because that built-in audience is now in charge of what gets made , the numbers do n't  lie . Hollywood wants tights . <p> Sometimes the results are well worth the effort . Really really worth it , like The Dark Knight or The Incredibles . Sometimes the results are absolutely horrible , like Daredevil or the more recent Iron Man 2 movie . What gives ? Clearly they cover the same material . What is it that sets The Incredibles apart from other comic-book style films like the original Superman or Jaws where defeating the bad guy was everything ? <h> Some Pretty Incredible Storytelling <p> Is every superhero story really about beating the bad guy ? Brad Bird would n't have you think so . In his masterful The Incredibles , Bob and friends pair off against the measly and less-than-incredible Syndrome . In the end , they defeat him , bringing the story to a resounding Triumphant success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the problem that there is this well-funded wannabe wrecking havoc across the city or is there perhaps something a little more sophisticated going on ? <h> Stories Are About Solving Problems <p> The Inciting Incident brings an inequity into the lives of the characters within the story , creating an imbalance that begs for some sort of resolution . This is why stories exist in the first placeto grant us some greater meaning when it comes to solving problems in our own lives . The Inciting Incident is simply the first step in that process . <p> Sometimes those inequities are resolved , as with Inception or The Town , other times they are not . Films like Rain Man or Into the Wild are perfect examples of films where those efforts to resolve problems end in failure . Either ending is perfectly acceptable . All that matters is that the Author knows what it is they want to say , and is clear about saying it . <p> The Incredibles issues begin with Bobs loss in court against failed suicide-jumper Oliver Sansweet . Before then , everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much . It forces he and his family and every one of his friends into hiding . This event spawned an inequity within the lives of the characters , an inequity that Syndrome had relatively little to do with it ( yet ) . Defeating him would not correct things as he is not the source of the problems in their lives . <h> Superheroes Who Do n't  Get to Be Superheroes <p> This is the real problem at the heart of The Incredibles . With Bobs loss in court , the Supers were forced into hiding , unable to be what they feel they were born to be . Bob does n't  get to save the world , Helen has to pretend to be a happy housewife , and Dash has to act just like all the other kids in school . Those are some pretty hefty inequities at work there . Bob and his family have to do all these mundane activities because they ca n't live up to their potential . And they would continue to do so , if it werent for the story working out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antagonist <p> Beating Syndromes robot did n't  resolve the storys issues . Neither did beating him back at home . If he really was the source of all problems in the story , then his unfortunate cape incident would have made everything better . It would have cleared the inequity . <p> However , it was only once Violet put up her shield and lived up to her full potential that the problems in the story were finally resolved . Bobs family , and by extension the rest of the Supers , found a way to be all that they can be . Sansweets settlement was righted . <h> Meaning Within the Ending <p> This solution of fulfilling ones potential was what was really at stake in the film . By constructing the story this way , the Author ( Brad Bird ) says , Look , see , if you go about solving your problems this way , this is the kind of result you can expect .. And the images of Bob and his happy family were proof positive that they had taken the right approach . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  focus on the same old obvious , tried and true treasure that lies at the end of the road .

When the Supers start living up to their potential and " being " the heroes they know they are supposed to be , then the problems in the story are finally resolved . <p> Interestingly enough , the Consequence of the Overall Storythe thing that will happen if the Goal somehow is not reachedis Doing . If Bob fails , all the Supers will have to continue doing the mundane and normal things they always have . The Consequence helps give motivation for the Goal to be attained .

The fallout from such thinking produced the well-worn , yet highly inaccurate , notion that every Main Character needs to change . <h> Understanding Pressure and Who Sits at the Controls <p> Imagine climbing into a diving bell and being lowered into the deep , blue sea . As you descend , the pressure on the outside of the bell increases . This requires you to compensate for the pressure by building up pressure on the inside so that there remains a balance between internal and external . Each change in depth requires further attention towards maintaining that balance . <p> If you raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the outside and there is the threat of an explosion if internal pressure is n't reduced . If instead you were to lower the diving bell , the pressure on the inside would become less than the outside and there would be the threat of an implosion if internal pressure is n't increased . <h> Internal or External : Which One is Unpredictable ? <p> In a complete story , either the external or internal forces applied to the diving bell will seem to flow naturally ( or predictably ) , while the other will seem to have some sort of uncontrollable or unreasonable element to it . In this second example , the one at the controls will be the unpredictable factor . <p> In stories where the Main Character ultimately transforms , they will appear to be the unpredictable side of the equation . As the external pressure increases or decreases , the Main Character either can not stop using the controls of the diving bell and overcompensates , or is unwilling to use the controls sufficiently enough to prevent discomfort or harm . An example of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children manifest themselves as projections of his attempts to overcompensate for the guilt he feels for his participation in his wifes suicide . An example of the latter can be found with Bud in The Apartment . His unwillingness to stand up for himself describes perfectly that character who , for whatever reason , refuses to change the pressure within the bell . The imbalance increases until finally he has no other choice than to change . <h> When the External Becomes Erratic <p> In stories where the Main Character maintains their resolve throughout the moment of crisis , the Main Character is perfectly willing to go along for the ride , but whomever or whatever is controlling the ascension or descension of the diving bell is erratic or uncompromising . A perfect example of this can be found in any one of the Bourne movies . Jason Bourne , while somewhat unpredictable from an external perspective , is completely unwavering on the inside , much like his country cousin James Bond ( except for the most recent Casino Royale where Bond breaks the mold as a Steadfast Main Character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other principal character , the one with which the Main Character develops a meaningful relationship , that becomes the unpredictable factor . <p> In the first Bourne movie , The Bourne Identity , it is Bournes girlfriend Marie who is the uncontrollable one , her allegiance and complicity with his actions forcing him to maintain balance . In the second , The Bourne Supremacy the person working the crane holding Bournes diving bell is CIA Analyst Pamela Landy . Like her counterpart Sam Gerard in The Fugitive , Pamela works as the wildcard , erratic in her attempts to fully assess the situation . And finally , in The Bourne Ultimatum it is fellow assassin Paz who is uncompromising in his efforts to lower Bourne deeper and deeper into the ocean . <p> In all three films , it is that other character that ultimately transforms and brings back balance between the internal and external worlds . <h> Who Is At Fault Here ? <p> In stories where the Main Character ultimately changes their nature , they often appear to be the cause of their own difficulties . Inception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have trouble keeping that pressure level bearable within that diving bell . In stories where the Main Character remains true to their nature , they will appear to be the victim or pawn of larger forces . Trapped within that diving bell , they do what they can to maintain equilibrium . Jason Bourne , Dr. Richard Kimble , Salieri - stories of steadfast resolve center around characters at the mercy of external forces . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> This concept of the diving bell and the Main Character originated with an initial conversation with Chris Huntley , one of the co-creators behind the Dramatica theory of story . It is an attempt ( a fantastic attempt ) to qualify the difference between Main Character Resolve and Main Character Growth . <p> When it comes to Main Character Growth , Stop and Start affect the controls of the crane raising and lowering the diving bell ( external world ) , as well as the controls inside the bell increasing and decreasing the internal pressure ( Main Character ) . <p> In a Change story , the Main Character is the unpredictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant stop using the controls or overcompensates as pressure increases and decreases .

@@119272847 @8272847/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Unlocking the Structural Code of the Story Goal <p> Stories that amble along needlessly often suffer from the lack of a clearly defined Goal . Without that drive towards resolution , a work of fiction can meander from one pointless scene to the next . Determining the source of difficulties guarantees clarity of purpose for any story . <p> In the article The True Champion of Chinatown , the Goal of the story was identified as Securing the Family History , with creepy tycoon Noah Cross ( John Huston ) at the helm . This rather wild notion runs counter to more popular understandings of the film . Many see Jake Gittes ( Jack Nicholson ) front and center , pursuing the Goal of revealing the Cross family secret . This seems to be the most obvious understanding of the goal , yet as that article established , seeing Jakes goal as the goal of concern to everyone fails to take into account the differential between the objective and subjective views of the story . Still , it does seem unusual to think of the Goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For that matter , how come in this analysis of How to Train Your Dragon the Goal was identified as Training the Next Generation of Dragon Killers ? Shouldnt it be to kill the big bad monster dragon ? And if the Goal of The Matrix is to take down the Matrix itself , why isnt the Goal of Star Wars to blow up the Death Star ? Are n't  they the same story ? <p> The answer to all of these questions lies within a better appreciation of the true genesis of a story . <h> In the Beginning there was balance <p> Here is how it works : Before story , balance exists . The world rests at peace . Something or someone interjects itself upon this serene scene , instantly creating an inequity . Sensing this new imbalance , our minds label the differential a problem and naturally begin the process of resolving that problem . <p> Problems do n't  exist in a vacuum . In fact , problems ca n't be problems without solutions . Achieving the solution to the storys inequity then becomes the Goal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come attached to any one character . No one owns the Goal of a story , rather it attracts and repels everyone within . Some will be for it while others would rather the inequity persist . Some may even be responsible for starting the problem in the first place . Regardless , look not to individual wants and needs for the Goal of a story . Seek the initial inequity and work from there . <h> My kingdom for a solution ! <p> In Chinatown , problems begin when Hollis refuses to build the new dam , thus screwing up Noahs plans for familial and urban reunification . Resolving that issuean issue that affects everyone in the storybecomes job one for the man in the white hat . <p> Likewise in The Matrix , Morpheus places his faith in Mr. Andersen , screwing up the nice little gig Agent Smith and his band of human harvesters had going on . Balance becomes imbalance and resolution takes center stage . The Goal that grows out of this desire for resolutionDismantle the Matrixdid not stem from someones own personal wants or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that initial choice of simple Mr. Andersen . <p> In Star Wars , the imposing Empire overextends itself by boarding a diplomatic ship . In the past these overlords were simply annoying , now it seems they 've crossed the line . Would blowing up the Death Star really resolve this inequity ? Not really . The destruction of the Death Star only appears to be the Goal of the story because of the nature of Goals themselves . <h> When achieving the Goal is the Goal <p> Ask an Author the Goal of their story and theyll naturally reply So and so needs to win the heart of his loved one or The bandits need to find the lost treasure or The copy girl needs to secure more clients . Goals of achievement are easiest to identify ( and thus easiest to write ) because Goals themselves are achievements . A problem enters the characters lives and many of them set out to acquire the appropriate solution . That said , their motion towards this ending does not constitute what kind of resolution is needed . Do not confuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Story Goal . The first defines the static nature of a structural point , the other defines the process undergone in getting there . <h> Goals of acquirement <p> So when it comes to a film like The Matrix , Dismantling the Matrix works as a natural Goal to resolve Morpheus faith in Neo . Not only is the Goal something to be achieved but its also about achieving . Think of this kind of goal as acquiring something or winning something or destroying something . The act of obtaining ( or freeing ) resolves the storys imbalance . <p> Kung Fu Panda , Unforgiven , Casablancaall of these films share a similar kind of Goal . In Kung Fu Panda troubles begin when disgruntled former student Tai Lung escapes from prison . Finding the True Dragon Warrior to defeat this new threat returns balance to all those involved . Same with Casablanca . Ugarte hands the Letters of Transit over to Rick and suddenly there is trouble for the great and noble Viktor Laszlo .

Two cowpokes scar an innocent woman sparking a reward for revenge . Killing Anyone and Everyone Involved secures resolution for the inhabitants of Big Whiskey . Now , it does little to resolve the demons locked away in William Munnys head ( in fact it has quite the opposite effect ) , but remember that the Goal of the Story is story-wide , it is not tied to the personal issues of any one character . It is objective and universal . <h> When Goals move beyond winning or losing <p> But what about Star Wars ? Surely this simple sci-fi flick explores nothing more than good guys beating the bad guys . But that 's just itin the battle between Rebellion and Empire just being able to fight back works better than a particular instance of achievement . The doing becomes more important than the obtaining . <p> In future articles in this series on Story Goals well take a look at more sophisticated resolutions similar to the one found in a galaxy far far away . Looking towards the initial inequity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goal would satisfy that drive to return things to a state of balance . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Dramatica refers to the Goal of a story as the Overall Story Goal . This is seen as separate ( yet tied thematically ) to the Main Characters Concern or the Influence Characters Concern , both which may be seen as goals in and of themselves . The Overall Story Goal resides wholly within the objective view of a story provided by the Overall Story Throughline . <p> The Overall Story Goal begins with the initial Story Driver or what many have previously referred to as the Inciting Incident .

This is even more important in a film like The Prestige where the Main Character is also the Protagonist not always the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal moment from the Main Character point-of-view actually turns out to be a choice or action taken from their point-of-view as the primary driver of the main story . <p> If one were to overlook all of Angiers actions as Protagonist ( and his goal of trying to understand how Borden does the Transported Man trick ) , his most personal issues deal with his desire to be the very best , his obsession with the adulation of the audience , and of making them forget their ordinary livesif even for a second or two . These are the kinds of issues he would take with him into any story as they are the problems central to his very nature . They coalesce nicely with the rest of the story , but they can be seen as separate and individual and most importantly , personal to him . <p> Scenes where we the audience see the Main Character alone are often chock-full of these sort of personal thematic issues . In The Prestige we get such a moment during Angiers first performance of his own Transported Man trick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes his triumphant bow from below the stageout of sight of the adoring audience but thankfully within earshot . His desire for that love , regardless of how he has to get it , speaks volumes about his character . <p> Another often-used device in communicating this personal throughline is to have another character in the story point out plainly and clearly what the Main Characters real problem is . This is not the same as the Impact Character , who by their very existence in the story forces the Main Character to deal with their personal issues , but rather a character who simply comes out and says , " Hey , you know what your problem is ? " David Bowies Tesla fills this role when he warns Angier of proceeding : <p> TESLA I can make your machine , Mr. Angier . But I can also give you some advice ( pointed ) Go home . Forget this thing . I can recognize an obsession . As Mr. Alley could tell you , I myself am given to one now and then . It will not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you no good ? <p> TESLA At first . But I 've followed them too longI am their slave . Their whipping boy . And one day they may choose to destroy me . <p> Angier looks into Teslas eyes . <p> ANGIER If you understand an obsession then you know you wo n't change my mind . <p> And thus we have a perfect example of a Main Character moment . With these issues at the core of what Angier is personally struggling with it becomes obvious that he grew INTO his resolve , not out of it . His desire began as a small kernel of motivation , but eventually grew into something that consumed him , resulting in his eventual destruction . This was , of course , the meaning behind the whole piece . <h> The Difference Between Resolve and Growth <p> Resolve , which is what we are concerned with when determining whether a character ultimately changes or stays true to their nature , sits apart from the actual characters growth . Their growth is how they get there , how they end up at that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stone their resolve . Main Characters can waffle back and forth through the story ( and probably should for the sake of interest ) , but it is that final culminating moment that ultimately defines them . Have they grown to a point where they are ready to let it all go and see the world anew ? Or have they determined for themselves that yes , the way they have been going about this is truly the way to go . <p> Angiers need to " get his hands dirty " was something he had to grow into , but was always something he had the potential for . Only then could the audience begin to love him the way he wanted them to . He had moments of doubt , moments when he considered changing , but in the end , in the end he stuck with that desire for fame . <p> Borden , on the other hand , completely transforms his worldview . The key scene for this happens when his wife asks the twin brother ( the one more interested in Johanssen ) whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he met her , Borden has been driven to keep up the perception that both he and his brother were one and the same . How else could he successfully pull off the trick of the century without this elaborate deception ? The only problem is that this success came with a pricethe emotional torture of his innocent wife . Eventually , and in no small part to his interactions with Angier , Borden comes to a place where he just cant keep it up any longer and reveals to her the truth : <p> INT .

Reality has taken over as his new approach to solving problems and one can imagine that , moving forward , Borden and his brother might choose a different line of work . Unfortunately , in undergoing this transformation of character , Borden breaks Sarahs heart , revealing to her that all along the trick was more important than their relationship . Motivated by this new revelation , his wife feels as if she has no other alternative than to take her own life . <p> In sharp contrast , there is no way Angier would give up that stage for anything or anybody . <h> Clarity of Character <p> Separating out the throughlines , determining the difference between a characters resolve and their personal growth , clarifying which principal character transforms and which maintains their point-of-viewall of these are tools a writer can use to insure that their story stays consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and non-linear as The Prestige , understanding precisely what is going with the characters that populate it can go a long way towards making sure the audience does not leave befuddled or overcome with unanswered questions .

Interestingly enough , Angier does enjoy his Solution of Ability the moment he is able to finally do the real Transported Man trick . If he was a Change character this Ability would have resolved his issues . Unfortunately , he continues on and devises a scheme ( Relationship Story Concern of Conceptualizing ) to seek the ultimate revenge on Bale .

Key to drawing them in and keeping them there lies with the proper application of the Main Characters perspective . Lose sight of the Main Character and writers risk losing their Audience . <p> A disturbing trend of late seems to be on the rise within narrative fiction : that of the undefined or ill-defined Main Character Throughline . The Croods , End of Watch , Prometheus , and the latest James Bond thriller Skyfall all fail to offer Audiences consistent points-of-view from their Main Characters . Sure , they might entertain us with visual delights from worlds light-years away or they might engage us viscerally with uniformed life on the streets of L.A. , but without consistency in where we witness these events from the experience falls into insignificance . <p> As popular as Skyfall was , what exactly was the film trying to say ?

This unique and central character grants the Audience a way into the mind of a story .

From this point-of-view the Audience gets to experience what it is like to personally face this issue . <p> Contrast this with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Influence Character . The Audience does not experience what it is like to actually be this character , but rather watches what this character does and how they behave . This experience of watching another work through a problem " influences " us the Main Character ( as the Audience we have assumed the collective position of the Main Character ) to reconsider our own issues and how we approach them . <p> Thus , the Main Character Throughline offers the Audience a reference point from which to interpret everything that happens on-screen or in print . When arguing a particular approach to problem-solving it becomes necessary to establish who were looking at and who is looking at us . Conflict does not occur within one viewpoint but rather between disparate viewpoints . You and I. Because of this reality , perspective regions supreme . <h> The Dangers of Altering Perspectives <p> Baz Luhrmans take on The Great Gatsby should prove to be interesting .

This runs counter to what can be found in the original novel . According to the official Dramatica analysis of The Great Gatsby , it is Nick ( Tobey Maguire in the film ) that operates as the Main Character while Gatsby actually takes on the Influence Character role . True , we get hints of a first-person perspective from Nick ( Tobey Maguire ) within the trailer , but the majority of scenes depict the struggles of Gatsby and his relationship with Daisy . <p> Altering these key points-of-view threatens the meaning of the story .

Altering the perspectives because of a fascination with a particular performance ( which seems to be the case here ) can lead to confusion over the message of a story . <h> Lessons from the Past <p> Consider Neil Simons classic Barefoot in the Park and the Main Character of that story : Paul Bratter ( Robert Redford ) . Clearly the original play called for us to see Corie ( Jane Fonda ) through Pauls eyes : Simon went so far as to even call Paul out for being a " watcher , not a Do-er . " Yet here too , the adaptation devoted so much of its attention on Fondas inspired and captivating performance that it lost sight of Pauls personal issues . Many probably do n't  even remember what Pauls issues were ( assuming theyve even seen the film ) . <p> The Dramatica analysis of Barefoot in the Park correctly identifies Pauls issues of being overly-responsible when it comes to juggling time spent with his new wife and time spent with his new job .

Like Bond in Skyfall , Pauls struggle falls to the wayside threatening the Authors original intent in the process . <h> Adaptation and Medium <p> Part of the problem lies in the fact that this film originally existed as a play . It becomes rather difficult to establish perspective when the Audiences actual point-of-view towards the performance of a play remains fixed ( i.e. in their seats , watching the stage ) . Short of extended soliloquies the stage offers little help for writers attempting to center their Audience . In film , shot selection and composition can set and delineate perspective concretely . In The Shawshank Redemption the Audience experiences what it is like to walk the long hall down to a parole-board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold-blooded killer like Andy Dufresne by witnessing these events through Reds eyes .

The major structural pieces may be in place , but upon closer examination the narrative breaks down and leaves one wanting more . <p> Steven Spielbergs Bridge of Spies is no tale as the four major Throughlines lock into place fairly early . James Donovan ( Tom Hanks ) provides the Main Character Throughline wherein we experience what it feels like to be the one man in a unique position to prevent nuclear annihilation . Rudolf Abel ( Mark Rylance ) offers us the cynical numbed-out alternative perspective to Donovans optimism with his Influence Character Throughline .

@@119272856 @8272856/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> The Reason for Acts <p> When tackling the immense project that is a work of narrative fiction , many writers begin by dividing up the events that occur in their story into separate general areas commonly referred to as Acts . Whether done instinctively or because of something once read , most agree that this practice is both universal and helpful . <p> But what is left out of many of the discussions concerning Acts is why they even exist in the first place . Is it really simply a way of dividing a story up into Beginning , Middle and End as Aristotle believed thousands of years ago ? Or could there possibly be a more meaningful reason why stories naturally move through four distinct areas ? If one accepts the idea that stories are about solving problems , then the reason for Act divisions becomes clear . <h> Problem-Solving and Act Turns <p> The Inciting Incident occurs , introducing a problem into the lives of the characters who inhabit a story . In order to resolve it , a certain approach is takensome characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are firmly against such an endeavor . The two forces battle it out until all the dramatic conflicts within that one particular approach are exhausted . If the problem continues to exist , a new approach must be taken , and thus , a brand new Act is required . <p> This is why Acts exist within a story . They signify the change in dramatic focus the characters take in order to solve the problems within a story . The reason there are only four acts in every complete story is because for every problem we can experience in our lives , there are four major contexts , or dramatic approaches , we can take in order to go about effective problem-solving . <h> Four Acts , Four Contexts <p> Let 's say , for example , that we are writing a story about a group of boxers and the challenges they face rising up through the amateur circuit . Their struggles come because they simply are n't  very skilled boxers . Sure , they might have mental blocks or doubts about their abilities , but the true focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We want to write a complete story , and thus want to make sure that we cover all four contexts from which to examine this particular problem . When it comes to physical activities like this , the four basic contexts are DOING , OBTAINING , UNDERSTANDING and LEARNING . Once our boxers have moved through these four areas they will have explored every aspect of boxing from a physical standpoint and will have either found a way to solve their problem , or not . <p> The first , and probably most easy context to " get " is the context of actually DOING something . In this act , our group of boxers would explore the difficulties and conflicts created by body blows and uppercuts . The older more experienced boxers would challenge the younger ones and individual skill levels would be brought to test . There would be a lot of pain in this Act . <p> The second context would concern itself with OBTAINING something . Here , the group of boxers would perhaps duke it out to see who will end up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked between their legs . There could be lives taken in this Act , if not arms broken , and falls taken for money . Anything and everything to do with achieving or losing something would fall into this category . <p> The third context deviates from the first two in that , at first glance , it seems to delve into more of a mental context . However , this is not so , as the struggle towards UNDERSTANDING something is truly a physical problem . In this act , the boxers would battle against their previous training , perhaps fighting their instincts to cover-up when their trainer wants them to open up instead . There would be accusations of cheating and confusion over one boxers proclivity to feint at the sight of blood . <p> See how our story is suddenly beginning to feel more full ? <p> Proponents of a three Act story structure would tell you that that is it , you 've covered the three basic movementsBeginning , Middle and Endand now its time to wrap things up . But you know that feeling you 're experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or has yet to be covered ? That is the same feeling an audience experiences when a writer has failed to cover all four contexts . This is a feeling that should be avoided at all costs . <p> The fourth and final context of solving the physical problem of boxing comes with LEARNING something . Initially , it may be difficult to see the difference between this and the previous context , but if you think of Learning as the actual collecting of information and Understanding the act of making sense of it all , the differences should become apparent . <p> In this fourth Act , the boxers would learn new techniques , analyze film footage of previous bouts , and argue over what the line-up might be for the next tournament . They might discover one of them needs special treatment and spend late nights in the ring helping him out . They might even spy on the other group of amateurs across town . Anything to do with the struggles involved in the gathering of information would find a home in this Act . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There would be no need to go back and show more scenes of fighting , or have yet another scene of someone losing their house because of their dedication to the sport . Those struggles , those contexts , have already been explored and movement has been made forward towards the ultimate resolution of the initial problem created by the Inciting Incident . To go back would be redundant , and completely unnecessary . <h> Problem-Solving At the Movies <p> As with the previous example regarding the group of boxers and the amateur circuit , the following film examples will focus primarily on the problems experienced by everyone in the story . Complete stories , especially films as wonderful as those below , are complex thematic explorations of different problems seen from many different points-of-view . In order to keep this article as focused and as simple as it can be , much of the more personal and heartfelt moments of each individual story will be left for another time . For now , we will hone in on the major problems that affect every character in the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolves around an Empire that has grown ruthless in its efforts to contain any rebellion . This problem begins with Darth Vaders attack on Princess Leias ship and continues until the eventual destruction of the Death Star . <p> The First Act explores the fallout from Vaders attack and the Rebels new Understanding of what it is they are dealing with now . The Act culminates with the Empires attack on the Jawas and Lukes Aunt and Uncle . The Second Act finds the Rebels Learning the true destructive power of the Empire when the evil baddies test their weapon out on Alderaan . The Third Act has Luke and Co . Doing what they can to fight the Empire as it hunts down the hidden Rebel Base . And finally , the Fourth Act finds both good guys and bad guys fighting it out over who can destroy the other one first . <p> With this last Act , the story can end . Every context from which to examine an out-of-control governing body has been explored . They first tried to understand , then they were forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally ending with winning and losing . Any further understanding or fighting would have required an entirely new story . Jumping from the Understanding to the Doing would have left the story feeling empty and hollow . <p> Four acts , four contexts from which to examine a problem . <h> Unforgiven <p> The major problem of Unforgiven surrounds a group of no-good assassins and their attempts to collect reward money for what many deem a reprehensible act . The problem begins with the Sheriffs less-than-equitable punishment for the abuse of an innocent woman and ends with William Munny exacting revenge for those who decided to decorate their saloon with his friend . <p> The First Act finds the whores Understanding Little Bills warped sense of justice and their solution of offering up a reward for revenge . The Second Act turns with the arrival of English Bob and forces the Sheriff into teaching everyone what happens to killers and villains who come to Big Whiskey in search of the whores gold ( Learning ) . The Third Act has William Munny and friends hunting down those responsible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward , especially when others cant . And finally , the Fourth Act forces Munny into exacting revenge upon his friends killers , killing whoever stands in his way ( Obtaining ) . <p> Once again , we have that feeling of completeness that comes from fully exploring every way to solve the problem at hand . If for some reason David Webb Peoples ( the screenwriter of Unforgiven ) had left out the conflict that comes when Ned ca n't Do what they came to do , the film would have felt less complete . It would have been similar to those times when someone leaves out a key portion of their argument , if only because it bolsters their position . The audience knows when a story " skips " over a key context in solving a problem . Exploring all four insures that the audience will leave satisfied . <h> Meaningful Plot Progression <p> Note that the Act order of this Academy-Award winning Western is exactly the same as that of the popcorn science-fiction classic , Star Wars . It starts with an Understanding that moves into Learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , is there anyone out there who would contend that these two films are the same ? <p> Story structure does n't  and shouldnt dictate what kinds of scenes should show up in a story . It shouldnt require a " Call to Adventure " or a " Dark Night of the Soul " or any other simplistic interpretation of story structure that has no real meaning or hampers writers with the same kinds of scenes over and over again . It should , however , provide the necessary order of events needed to produce the kind of meaning an Author hopes to instill in the audience , leaving them plenty of room to write whatever their heart tells them . That is what happens when Acts are seen as progressive contexts for examining a problem . This is the way complete stories are written . <p> Both Star Wars and Unforgiven called for this plot progression of Acts because of the story they were trying to tell . Different stories call for different plot development depending upon the Authors choice of certain structural and dynamic choices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although they explore the same four contexts of Understanding , Doing , Learning , and Obtaining , do so in a different order , thus producing a completely different kind of meaning . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Dramatica refers to these different contexts as Signposts . While the above explanation focused its attention on the Objective Story Throughline ( the throughline that considers everyone in the story , regardless of personal issues ) , there are other Signposts for each of the remaining three Throughlines ( Main Character , Impact Character , and Relationship Story Throughline ) . In this way , the problem that sits at the center of the story can be explored from every single perspective . This is what gives a story meaning . <p> Star Wars and Unforgiven have Objective Stories that reside in the Physics Domain , thus the reason why the four Signposts are Understanding , Doing , Learning , and Obtaining . These are the four contexts from which problematic activities can be explored . The other Throughlines would have completely different contexts depending on where they resided within the structural chart .

Like the captains of the music and publishing industries before them , movie producers and studio executives alike are coming to terms with the destructive force of technological instant gratification . <p> Digital 3D presentations and theaters that serve you popcorn on a silver tray are simply panicked stop-gap procedures for covering up the true malignancy at hand : rancid storytelling . Constructing narratives based on paper-thin notions of story structure and stuffing them full of pointless reversals and reactions to last minute audience screenings only widens the pool of ambivalence . The Audiences trust and goodwill long since gone . <p> The only safe harbor for fans of meaningful fiction lies within cable and in particular , HBO .

Offering a methodical journey into the classic psychological drama of the mid-20th century , this latest gem confidently delivers the respect audiences both crave and deserve . <h> Five Parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it tells a complete story . While split into five separate episodes , the storys exploration of a mother coming to terms with her daughters true nature maintains a definite structure that persists up to , and including , its final meaningful ending . <p> Mildred ( Kate Winslet ) sits at the center of the narrative and functions as the Audiences " in " to the story . Recently appointed a " grass widow " by virtue of her husband leaving her , the abandoned single mom takes up position as a waitressan occupation well below her middle-class status . Mildreds precocious daughter , Veda ( Morgan Turner and Evan Rachel Wood ) , offers the alternative point-of-view that kicks Mildreds emotional growth into high gear . Headstrong and opinionated about everythingincluding the class differential between Glendale and Pasadena and the status of her pregnancy ( " Right now , its a matter of opinion " ) the young ingenue pushes Mildreds buttons with ruthless precision . <p> Together , the two characters form the heart of the story with their contentious mother/daughter relationship . Central to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that Veda has something that Mildred once had , but eventually lost . Maintaining that spark , that uniqueness , becomes all consuming for Mildred , driving her to take action as Protagonist in the larger story . <p> It is here that the other characters work their way into the storys problem . Monty Beragon ( Guy Pearce ) , Ida ( Mare Winningham ) , and even supposed confidant Wally Burgan ( James LeGros ) play a part in Mildreds efforts to bring Veda closer to her . The problem is that Mildred is not the only one with a plan . Monty , Ida , Wally , and even Veda play into her game , but only insomuch as it serves their own devious schemes . <p> And it is here that one can begin to see the central problem at hand . <h> The Thoughtless and the Thoughtful <p> As with the titular character in Shakespeares Hamlet , Mildred suffers from " enormous , intellectual activity " ( Coleridge , 1818 ) . In other words , she thinks too much . But while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildreds excess of thought drives her to take actions that only make her situation worse .

It spreads and affects everyone in the story . Embezzling from her own company and treating her boyfriend/husband like the help are but a few examples of what Mildred is willing to do to keep Veda happy and thinking well of her . In the final , dastardly reveal Monty challenges her : <p> MONTY : What did you think Mildred ? That you could pay for all this stuff and she 'd come running back to the teat ? <p> That is what she thought and why it is so painful for her to hear .

Subjectively , and more personally , we get to feel what it is like to have this problem by experiencing the storys events through Mildred herself . Objective and subjective views . It is this simultaneous reality that elevates Mildred Pierce and showcases The Real Magic Behind Great Stories . <h> Ending the Way It Should <p> In addition to their similarities in regards to the storys central problem , both Mildred Pierce and Hamlet share the same outcome .

As covered in the article How to Write a Tragedy , stories that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storys central goal and a Main Character who becomes emotionally crushed by failing to resolve their own personal angst . <p> Objectively , failure abounds . The loss of the business to Ida , the end of the friendship with Wally , the dissolution of the marriage with Monty , and the collapse of a family life with Veda all point to a Protagonist who has lost . In fact Veda is the only one who wins . Snaking her way out of the contract , seducing Monty and securing a life of status in New York are proof that she is the storys only winner . As the Antagonist in a Tragedy , it follows proper story structure and gives the Audience the satisfaction they 're looking for in a well-told story . Twisted , but satisfying . <p> Subjectively , Mildred closes the story in agony . Faced with no other choice but to accept the knowledge that her only daughter is , in fact , a bad person is not how she had hoped things would work out . Throughout the story , Veda accurately points out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capable of deceiving and manipulating others , treating those she comes into contact with as worthless pawns , what does that say about Mildred ? Declaring " To Hell with Veda " is simply an acceptance of an unavoidable and unfortunate reality . Maybe those of a lower class ( of character , not station ) are n't  born that wayperhaps they 're simply a victim of their upbringing . <p> The greatest thing about this final outcome is that it is exactly how the story should have ended . Mildred Pierce was trying to argue a point-of-view on the poisonous effects of worrying about what someone thinks of you to the exclusion of all else . If the producers and writers had somehow tacked on a " happy ending " because of low numbers in early screenings , they would have broken the storys argument and turned this miniseries into a meaningless disaster . <h> Meaning Is the Thing <p> The miniseries is often compared to the novel , and for good reason .

But the success of these miniseries and the obvious superiority they maintain over their cousins at the cinema lies in the soundness of their story structures rather than simply the pleasure of time they have . <p> Mildred Pierce may have felt slow at times , but the end result is an experience that was worth the time . How often can one say that for recent movies that are often less than an hour and a half ? <p> Perhaps it is only the season . The Kings Speech and The Black Swan are two examples of solid story structures from last year that began their life at the cinema . But it does seem as though these films are becoming the exception rather than the rule they were in decades past . <p> Writers are flocking to cable because television offers the chance to tell stories that mean something , that offer something more than grandiose spectacle .

Carrying both the logistical and emotional arguments of a story within the same two characters can often lead to confusion over the thematics explored . It can also lead to a story feeling a bit " light " . <p> Mildred Pierce took this approach , but did so elegantly . <p> The usual technique to combat this emaciated situation is to carry the Impact Character role/Subjective Story relationship into another character .

This , in combination with the Story Judgment of Bad creates a story where the Main Character is growing towards something detrimental , or " bad .

Because this throughline represents the perspective of They , it covers a more objectified look at the characters . Instead of the heartfelt romance , here we see the commandant father , the chaotic kids , the governess , the baroness and so on . Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer as players fulfill roles in both the Relationship Throughline and this more objectified Overall Story Throughline .

That bittersweet song the Captain sings during the final concert , the song of the Austria he remembers and will always remember ( " Edelweiss " ) , resonates so strongly because it is a bridge between the first story and the second . Reminded of how happy his family once was , the Captain carries this over into his realization that he is losing his bigger " family " , his country .

Instead of taking an objectified look at the efforts to create a family , this story takes an objectified look at how the characters deal with the rise of Nazism . They deal with a specific mindset , one based on certain expectations as to how one should act . The Captain sits at the center of this conflict . Maria was the Protagonist in the first storydriving the efforts to make the von Trapps whole again . The Captain is the Protagonist in the second storytrying to stop his countrys knee-jerk response into fascism . The bittersweet feeling that comes at the end comes as a direct result of his failing as a Protagonist , the Nazis take Austria . <p> But he is n't the Main Character of this second story . <p> Instead , one need only look to Liesl , and her budding romance with Rolfe for the heart of this second story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strapping young lad takes over the role as Influence Character .

As mentioned before , real life events unfortunately do n't  have meaning . That 's why we have Authors . In order for the entirety of the von Trapp story to unfold and to unfold well , this second story needing crafting . To continue on after the wedding , as they did in real life , without an actual story to support it would have secured The Sound of Musics place in film history right beside Youve Got Mail or the countless other forgettable films that end their stories 30-45 minutes before the credits start to roll .

From there it is the first story that occasionally makes its presence known , tidying up any loose threads and offering any meaningful commentary ( such as the Captains song ) on the events that unfold . <p> While handing off the reigns of problem-solving from the first to the second , the Authors were careful to make sure that they did n't  infuse the wedding with a bombastic That 's All , Folks ! sort of moment that one finds at the end of Star Wars or Top Gun . They made sure they resolved the first inequity , but did it in such a way that the two stories , the story of the von Trapps , feel like one continuous piece . <p> But try as they did , they simply ca n't fool the human mind . <p> Because stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem loses that energy ( i.e. , the problem resolves ) so too does the audiences interest in a work of fiction .

They find a strong-willed native defined by what they believe ( Problematic Fixed Attitude ) . This belief forces the Main Character to grow , to reconsider how they approach things .

Yet in all these cases , the Main Characters still had a signficant relationship with another character who influenced their own point of view . Fonda had Lee Cobbb , Hiccup had his dad , and Wallace had Robert the Bruce . Each Main Character knew the impact and influence this other Influence Character had on them . <p> Chance never had a clue . His mental condition and his obliviousness to everything around him made him a Main Character impervious to any kind of persuasion .

The original term for Influence Character was Obstacle Character . Why Obstacle ? Because this characters primary role in a story is to act as an obstacle to the Main Character living their life blind to their own personal issues . <p> Every Main Character comes to a story packed with some sort of justifications for their behavior . These issues , built up during a time usually referrred to as Backstory , motivate the Main Character to behave the way they do .

We witness Being There through Chances eyes because we are new to this crowd of Washington players . It might be more difficult because of his mental condition , but we do n't  know what Rand has planned for Chance and the idea that a car would be waiting for us on demand is presented as something new and surprising .

Everyone accepts Chances words and embraces them with fervor . Everyone that is , except the Doctor . <p> Dr. Allenby is the only one who sees Chance for who he really is . From the very beginning he challenges Chance and his true intentions . He may not appear in the film often , but when he does it is always in opposition to Chances point-of-view .

Unfortunately there are times , as in the case of Being There , where the term muddles the true role of such a character and makes analysis a difficult task . It might also reduce the motivation to write stories with dynamics similar to this one . Understanding what this character truly does within a story , and refusing to be bogged down by more approachable and " friendlier " terminology , makes it easier to write and analyze successful narrative .

Finding Nemo transcends the animated film genre with an epic undersea adventure like no other , yet it is Marlins father-knows-best attitude that forces us to empathize deeply with a computer-generated image . <p> The biggest film of all time , Avatar , strangely enough suffers from a broken Main Character Throughline .

Same with 9 . Why should we care about post-apocalyptic puppets if were not given a personal struggle to latch onto ? Who the heck is 9 and what are the issues most personal to him ? Of Gods and Men ? The acclaim rests in the subject matter there , not in the execution . <p> These films , and countless others like them that rely on spectacle and sleight-of-hand to lull the senses . They suffer at the box office because they fail to latch on to the audiences sense of empathy .

One simply has to look to the Catalystor Inciting Incidentand find the life-changing event for the Protagonist . <p> No . Not that simple . <p> In fact , this line of thinking blatantly points out the reason why the Main Character Throughline must be clearly delineated from the Overall Story Throughline . <p> Taken offers a Catalyst that upsets the balance of things for Bryan Mills ( Liam Neeson ) , yet the rest of the film becomes one mindless action scene after the next . No emotional development , no growth of character , no personal issues anywhere . Thinking only of creating a life-changing event does not guarantee audience engagement because the Inciting Incident/Catalyst is part of the Overall Story Throughline NOT the Main Character Throughline . It upsets the balance of things for Bryan as Protagonist , not for Bryan as Main Character . <h> The Function of a Protagonist <p> The Protagonist functions within the context of the Overall Story Throughline .

The police , the daughter herself , the bad guys who took her , and yes , the Protagonist Mr. Mills . The abduction creates sympathy not empathywhich is right . Audiences should , and will sympathize with a Protagonist . <p> The Main Character Throughline , however , are those issues the Main Character would take with them into any story , not simply the one at hand . Their throughline , their struggle defines their character . This is why their connection to the Inciting Incident is not a prerequisite . <p> There are times , however , when the two coincide .

Mike may be doing something wrong , but we cant help but feel for him ( a natural reaction towards someone we empathize with ) . We root for Protagonists , we feel for Main Characters . <p> This personal throughline exists as well within the disconnected **33;27;TOOLONG Ryan Bingham ( George Clooney ) from Up In The Air . Layoffs and corporate restructuring may affect everyone in the story , but it is that carefree " I do n't  need anybody " attitude that only Ryan and we as the audience are privy to . <h> A Story Is A Story , No Matter How Small <p> The drive to create a blockbuster does not negate the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quiet character-driven piece like Blue Valentine or a monster-sized epic like The Lord of the Rings , the way a story works stays consistent .

The box office reflects their disappointment . If filmmakers desire blockbuster status , theyll only achieve it through a strong Main Character Throughline . <p> By taking the time to clearly identify those issues personal to the Main Character , a story becomes something more than simply a Protagonist trying to reach a Goal . It becomes something more than simply a shell who endures some life-changing event .

@@119272887 @8272887/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Achieving Story Goals that are Not Achievements <p> Far too often , Authors take what a Protagonist wants for granted . Acknowledging that this drive provides momentum for their narrative , they simply assign a task or reward for this character to work for . True freedom finds shape in the separation of the concept of the Story Goal from the Goal itself . <p> As covered in the article Unlocking the Structural Code of the Story Goal , the key towards identifying the main Story Goal rests in a firm grasp over when and where problems first start . While often mistakenly referred to as the Inciting Incident ( as it implies that this moment solely exists to " incite " the central character to action ) , this genesis of trouble begs for some sort of resolution . This reality of story structure gives fiction purpose , explains the motivations of the Protagonist , and can help aid writers who feel they are floundering about hopelessly within their own work . Unsure what it is your characters are really working for ? Look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goal needed to resolve it . <p> Goals in and of themselves are achievements , yet they do n't  need to be about achievements . They can beStopping Corruption in L.A. Confidential , Securing the Inheritance in Rain Man , and Winning the Competition in Surfs Up all provide excellent examples of how achieving itself can restore equity . But what about those stories that require a different kind of solution ? <h> Doing what needs to be done <p> In Star Wars the Empire boards a diplomatic ship , overextending their reach . The story that follows is n't so much about winning and losing as it is about dodging and striking ; the fight steals the center stage of purpose away from any specific prize or reward . Blowing up the Death Star works as a nice dividend for their efforts but works even better as an example of how to fight more effectively . Luckily , Luke had a nice little personal story running in parallel that helped everyone find that appropriate solution . <p> Same with The Dark Knight . Conflict did n't  arise from any specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Terror , and the manipulation of the response to it , became the central focus of the storys thematic exploration . The Joker absconds with the mobs life-savings leaving the good people of Gotham to find a way to protect their city from descending into chaos . Finding someone to focus their outrage onin this case Batman himself - provided the final resolution needed to quell the unbridled terrorism . Unlike Luke though , it came at a great personal cost to Bruce Wayne . Again , as with the example of Unforgiven in the previous article , the Goal of a story purposefully sits apart from any personal issues the central character may have . <p> How about Covering Stillwater for Rolling Stone in Cameron Crowes Almost Famous ? Accomplishing this with the skill and expertise lost among those twice his age becomes job one for William once being denied backstage at the Black Sabbath concert . Encompassing more than simply issues personal to him ( those have more to do with his mother ) , this Goal of accurate and truthful coverage becomes of concern to everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lester Bangsall of them work in concert towards that successful resolution . How well William does it becomes more important than whether or not he actually completes it . <h> Coming to a greater understanding <p> Shifting slightly from the difference between Goals of achieving and Goals of doing sit Goals of understanding . Although at first glance this may seem to be more internal in nature , this Goal of appreciation requires external effort . Consider the efforts to uncover what happened to LV-426 in Aliens . Losing contact with that colony starts the storys central problem , propelling dock-loader Ripley , corporate stooge Burke and a handful of Space Marines into a brutal physical process . Escaping with the knowledge they find ( their greater understanding ) resolves that initial inequity and allows everyone to sleep a little better . <p> The Sixth Sense shares the same kind of dynamic . Problems begin when a troubled patient shoots his therapist before turning the gun on himself . Figuring out why the patient did this and how possibly to keep it from happening again in young Cole becomes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the therapist pursues that greater knowledge . Now , he does have his own personal issues to contend with , but as far as Coles mom , friends and fellow students , doctors and various funeral attendees are all concerned understanding why Cole is the way he is resolves the storys central problem . <p> How about something a little less scary ? In The Sound of Music problems begin with Marias decision to leave the convent . This rebellious act opens up a whole can of worms far beyond simply Marias personal issues of what she should do with her lifeit opens up the Von Trapps to her wild influence . From tearing down drapes and wearing them as clothes to singing shamelessly amongst the Viennese hills , Maria threatens to destroy the precious Von Trapp familyor unite it . How to make the Von Trapps whole again after the loss of their matriarch ? That resolution of Story Goal comes with the final decision to wed , granting everyone the understanding needed to solve a problem like Maria . <h> Learning something new <p> Along the same line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to warrant its own classification , lie Goals of learning . Again , this may seem as if it should occur within the minds of the characters but the process of gathering information is a physical act . Think of the efforts to assess the intentions of the Arab prince in Lawrence of Arabia . Beginning with the Arab Bureaus decision to have their own man in the field , this film portrays the various attacks , executions , and massacres encountered on the road to further education . Learning how best to protect Britains interests in the region resolves and affirms Drydens initial decision by confirming the Empires drive to prosper . <p> Survival of a different sort , yet achieved in a dramatically similar fashion , finds life in Des Leben der Anderen ( The Lives of Others ) . Trouble starts with a Ministers decision to " watch " famed playwright Georg Dreyman and grows to a tipping point when a good friend of that very same playwright takes his own life . Convinced that resolution can only come in the dissemination of the current state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his incendiary article . Dovetailing beautifully into this Story Goal , the personal throughline of the secret service man assigned to watch Dreyman provides the final keys to success in much the same way that Lukes did in Star Wars . Information provides freedom . New information restores balance . <h> Goals of a different nature <p> Note that of all the examples given in this article and the one previous , the Goals in question are conspicuously all activities . Whether it be through obtaining something , doing something others cant , gaining a new understanding or struggling to learn something , each and every one of these Goals describes a physical activity . <p> But Goals can be so much more . <p> A failure of many a story paradigm persists in the notion that Goals must always be physical in nature . Whether it exists because most paradigms focus exclusively on films ( a primarily visual medium ) or because of the fixation on the achieving nature of the Goal itself , these purveyors of mistaken assumptions fail to see all that a Story Goal can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) or convincing others that anyone truly can cook ( as in Ratatouille ) are just two examples of Story Goals that find definition far outside the comfortable realm of external activity . Both find resolution within rather than without , both equally as valid as any described above , yet both distinctly different in nature enough to call for further exploration . <p> But first , before venturing inside for potential story solutions , one must take into account a reality of the external world . Many a problem finds its genesis within the vicious activities of others , yet pressure can also bubble up from an untenable state-of-affairs . Changing these problematic situations becomes the focus of our next article . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> The Story Goals examined in this article all reside within the Dramaticas Physics Domain ( or Activity Domain if you found the theory post-1998 ) .

Hah ! Totally random , but you can see how well these work together .

And they know their storys central character , one of those time-travellers who just wants to sing her way into her captains heart . For most that would be sufficient to write a first draft . <p> But that 's not enough for Dramatica . And its not enough for most audiences . Viewers ( and readers if this were to be a novel ) demand complete stories .

A caveman who ca n't stand being around his fellow neanderthals and whose bad temper and childish behavior humiliates and insults the people he is around .

In sharp contrast , you assume the role of Author and determine the source of conflict in your narratives individual storylines . While the end result is greater effectiveness in communicating your storys unique thematic message , it can be difficult figuring out exactly where your conflict falls . <p> One of these areas of conflict centers on psychological manipulations . Instead of looking at violent attacks or treasure hunts or living under English rule , stories that center on Psychology focus on conflict arising from how people think . <p> Dramatica breaks how people think down into four key types of conflict : <p> When it comes to the difference between Changing Ones Nature and Playing a Role it helps to think of the original terminology that shipped with Dramatica back in 1994 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that in the beginning you should frequently switch back and forth between the two different versions . <p> The " easy " terminologythe default setting for the most recent version of the softwarewas a marketing decision made a little over a decade to make Dramatica more palatable for writers new to the theory . The idea was that if they could somehow make the concepts friendlier and easier to understand , they could overcome some of the bad reviews surrounding the complexity of the theory . <h> Old School Dramatica <p> The original terminology for Changing Ones Nature and Playing a Role was Becoming and Being , respectively : <p> Becoming is more of a transformational whole-body change while Being is more transitory and temporary . For many raised in English-speaking countries , the difference seems inconsequential . As explained in Building Dramatica for Foreign Languages , the contrast reveals itself with more clarity in other countries : <p> Spanish does a much better job of defining the differences between these two . Both Ser and Estar mean " to be " , but in different ways . Ser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differs by establishing states of being , condition , or location , and is referred to as the Present Progressive . <p> With Being characters come into conflict by thinking they will behave or be a certain way for awhile to try and impress or manipulate someone . Consider the Supers in The Incredibles : characters pretending to be something they are not , in order to fit in with society . <p> Conflict surrounding the changing of ones nature exists in films like Moulin Rouge ! where each and every character strives to transform their essential nature and the nature of the Moulin Rouge itself . They believe that if all goes according to plan , the Moulin could become a serious destination for respectable theater . <p> Developing a Plan was originally labeled Conceptualizing , a FAR more interesting and compelling story point than simply describing some plan of action . Conceptualizing includes envisioning , imagining , and conceptually fitting components and people together . It can even be about figuring out how to make a relationship work .

But a film like Amelie focuses more on the conflict surrounding characters working to reinvent themselves . Both work to show Conceiving , but only the former easily slides into Conceiving an Idea . <h> Balancing Ease with Accuracy <p> Sometimes the strive to improve and reach more heads results in lowering oneself to the lowest common denominator . Dramatica is difficult to learn , and even harder to communicate and teach .

To understand why this film works so well requires a understanding of story more holistic in nature , an understanding that appreciates the various perspectives at conflict and brings them together into one seamless and purposeful model of human psychology . <p> The emerging field of narrative science lifts the veil of mystery shrouding this film and begins to improve the quality of discussion surrounding what makes great stories so great . <h> Projections of our projections <p> Those still saddled with the prerequisite of spiritual or mythological motive see stories as a method for understanding who we are and how the world works . Their templates of innermost caves and helpless cats make sense as a means to appreciate ourselves and our human experience . Clear away the aforementioned baggage , however , and reality shines through : Stories employ a structure based on how we see and make sense of our world , not the other way around . In other words , stories exist as projections of how we problem-solve . <p> When one asks why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies in how accurately the story projects the minds own problem-solving process . Beginning with a clear delineation of perspective and ending with a meaningful dissonance of both subjective and objective appreciations , the story of Red and Andy works because it follows a system familiar to all of us . <h> Four major points-of-view <p> Problem-solving requires a problem . In Shawshank , one word stands out above all others as the source of trouble : support . Whether implicitly applied by simply going with the flow ( " Yessir , I do believe I have been rehabilitated " ) or explicitly through the cheering on of " fresh fish " , an application of support creates conflict . <p> The Shawshank Redemption presents four unique perspectives on this problem of towing the line . The first lies within Red , the only guilty man in Shawshank . From his point-of-view we get to experience what it is like to personally have this problem . We follow him into the parole-board hearings , were there with him as this kid with the silver spoon up his ass arrives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's really been going on in Andys cell . We experience the story through Reds eyes . <p> But it is within those parole-board hearings that we truly experience the problem of supporting a system . Reds problem lies in his institutionalized way-of-thinking : he supports the system , believes it has helped him , and hat-in-hand tells everyone what he thinks they want to hear . <p> Of course , they continue to deny him until he finally begins to stand up for himself . Once he finally tells them to shove their assessmentonce he finally opposes the systemthe shackles of his problematic way-of-thinking clang to the ground and he leaves Shawshank a free man . <h> A prison for all <p> Stepping outside of Red and rising high into the air like that helicopter shot on the day Andy first arrives provides us with the storys second perspective . From here we begin to see the problems of support from an objective point-of-view . Red gave us that personal subjective perspective , looking at everyone dispassionately grants us distance and greater understanding . <p> An inmates promise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a brutal beating . The drive to support the educational development of the inmates leads to participation in and continuation of corruption . An agreement to be there for the wife-killing lawyer in the re-opening of his case , gets a young inmate shot for trying to " escape . " Contrast these various perspectives on the problem of support with those experienced through Red and one begins to gain a better appreciation of why stories draw us in . <p> Red stands up for himself because that was what was needed to overcome his personal problem . But how can we be sure of this solution without first seeing how it works within others ? From an objective point-of-view we can see that the same solution applies . Andys defiance with his broadcast of The Marriage of Figaro gifts freedom to the inmates of Shawshank ; for a moment , they were all free . His final act of opposition to the Wardens efforts of indoctrination furthers the viability of such a solution by showing it bringing down the walls of scandal within that prison . <p> Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member we get to experience what it is like to have support as a problem while at the same time we witness problems of support for everyone . <p> That does n't  happen in real life . <p> More on this later , but for now more investigation . These two perspectiveswhile comprehensive in their exploration of the problemfall short of telling the whole story . <h> An opposition towards justification <p> In order for Red to grow to the point where he can stand up for himself he needs to encounter a different point-of-view . One similar in scope to his own ( small , intimate ) , yet presented in a fashion similar to the objective view explained above . <p> Andy himself provides that needed third perspective . Interestingly enough , however , from this point-of-view a problem of support looks more like a problem of control . Whenever someone tries to clamp down on Andys activities or when he attempts to control a situation it impacts Red . Even the way he carries himself , cold and aloof , hits Red in a way that leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . <p> This distinction , of how Andys problem influences Red rather than how it effects Andy personally , defines the all-important third perspective of complete stories - the perspective of personal opposition . <h> Rounding it out with friendship <p> The most effective arguments stand on a firm ground of balanced perspective . Offer someone all the alternatives and your position will garnish greater acceptance by avoiding the trappings of a one-sided argument . The same concept applies to the different points-of-view within a story . Just as Reds intimate subjective perspective needed an intimate objective perspective to balance it out ( Andys point-of-view ) , the larger objective perspective of everyone colliding within the prison requires a smaller subjective perspective on the conflict of colliding viewpoints . In The Shawshank Redemption this point-of-view can be found in the friendship between Red and Andy . <p> From Reds point-of-view and the point-of-view of everyone trapped in the prison the problem of Shawshank appears to be an overabundance of support . From the point-of-view of Andy the problem looks like stifling control . However , from the point-of-view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither of these , preferring instead to appear as a failure to reconsider ones position . <p> " Hope is a dangerous thing , " Red tells Andy , succinctly verbalizing the sticking point preventing these two from ever becoming friends . Andy sees the world differently , preferring the dream of Zihuatenejo over Reds cynical consideration . The heart of the story revolves around this inability of either to change their mind ; the plight of their friendship resting on a simple decision : <p> " Get busy livin , or get busy dyin . " <h> The purpose of storytelling <p> These four distinct well-balanced perspectives exist for a reason . As mentioned before , the prison of our own minds prevents us from experiencing a subjective point-of-view at the same time we experience an objective point-of-view . We can not simultaneously be inside of ourselves and out . Stories grant us this rare opportunity to see a problem resolved from all different points-of-view . <p> The Shawshank Redemption offers up the argument that standing up and speaking out brings triumphboth universally and personally . The juxtaposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view transcends a simple " message " into a concrete argument . Rounding it out with a look at the actions of a life steeped in control and the inability of two to come together without a second glance at preconceived notions solidifies the Authors position within the minds of the Audience . <p> As Stephen King writes in his fantastic memoir On Writing : <p> Writing is telepathy , of courseI never opened my mouth and you never opened yours .

This initial action disrupts the balance of things and sets the Goal of whether or not the Rebels can figure out a way to fight an overarching Empire . <p> This runs counter to what most people think of as the " Inciting Incident " of Star WarsLukes retrieval of Leias message from R2 .

Writers strive for the pinnacle of their craft , but often fall short . Is there a way to circumvent the disappointment of failure ? <p> Writers do n't  set out to create a perfect story . They come to the table inspired by a character or a fantastic set piece , and they sit down to transpose these ideas into a workable captivating work of fiction . Inevitably these writers hit a wall . Some call it writers block , some call it exhaustion and some , unfortunately , call it quits . <p> Those who persevere often turn to established methodologies for crafting a story in an effort to find out where they went wrong , or how they can better push through . They learn to save a cat or enter the belly of a beast and they return to their work motivated to shore up their storys weak spots . Some succeed . Some manage to undermine all that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back of a seldom-used filing cabinet , never to return to it again . <p> But what if there was a model of story structure that promised to increase ones understanding of why stories work the way they do ? A modelor theoretical paradigmthat found its foundations not in observations of working stories but rather observational processes within the most perfect machine of all time : the human mind . <p> Would there be a chance then to save those forgotten drafts ? <h> The Process Behind Story <p> The Dramatica theory of story sets itself apart from previous paradigms with one simple notion : a complete story represents an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem . It covers plot . And it covers theme and character and genre and all those other things writers have grown accustomed to over the years . But instead of simply regurgitating and re-branding ideas of progressive complications and act turns into LONG ... it lays out the reason for plot points and character motivations and thematic issues as operational chunks of the human mind at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern ; they work because they project how we think and solve problems . Our minds find themselves drawn to fiction that works the way they do . <h> Playing With Fire <p> Knowing this , many writers new to Dramatica set out on a dangerous and ultimately crushing path : that of writing the perfect story . Once presented with a psychological model of their story ( known within the theory as the storyform ) , many adhere to this collection of thematic material as canon law . They refuse to veer off into new and unexplored territories , often thinking their diversions as aberrations to what truly should be . Hapless Authors such as these tumble into an unfortunate fate that fairs worse than simply inserting a Call to Adventure . <p> You ca n't blame themthe storyform is perfection . It works without fail . It tells writers things about their story they did n't  even know . How could one not trust an apparently sentient being ( even if it is a computer program ) that displays such a remarkable ability to understand and accurately predict what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? One would be foolish to follow instinct over tempered wisdom . <p> Unfortunately in doing so , one manages to extinguish the spark of life that inspired the work in the first place . <h> The Price of Perfection <p> Working this way , inspiration gives way to imitation . The process of writing becomes more exercise than experience , an attempt to showcase ones mastery of theory over ones mastery of spinning a story . Having witnessed this first hand in my years as a Dramatica consultant ( and my own earlier experience with the theory ) , I can attest to the fruitlessness of such an endeavor . Hours upon hours spent detailing an Overall Story Prerequisite of Preconscious or hand-wringing over the difference between a Symptom of Control and a Response of Uncontrolled or a Symptom of Uncontrolled and a Response of Control only leads to dusty drafts and forgotten dreams . <h> Learning to Embrace Objectivity <p> The alternative , of course , lies in the tried and tested Aristotelian paradigm of storyBeginning , Middle and Endleaving everything else up to " magic " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , would have left us isolated in our Universe , believing the planet we ride on flat and surrounded by sea monsters . Faith in the ancients would not have led to a jet-powered skycrane depositing a robotic science laboratory 230 meters away from its intended landing spot on a rock 154 million miles away . Faith in the past prevents progress towards a more knowledgeable future . <p> Once exposed to the thinking behind Dramatica , a writer must enhance their ability to quickly and easily shift from the subjective experience of writing and the objective analysis offered by the theory . Write , then step back and examine . Repeat as needed . And of course , one can start by stepping back and examining before writingbut writing must be allowed to happen without interference . <p> What happens when one veers from the storyform ? Create a new one . Rarelyin fact neverhave I witnessed the story process proceed from beginning to end without a change in the storyform itself .

But at least in this way , it becomes an informed rewrite . Long gone are the blind revisions that simply undermine the entirety of everything that went before it and leave the writer more lost and confused than ever before . <p> No one wants that . <h> Moving Forward by Pressing Through <p> Do n't  bury your head in the sand and pretend that your ego assumes all responsibility for success . Instead use Dramatica as the rock with which to rest yourself between drafts . Having done so , you will find yourself rested and more able to see that spark ignite into a bright and beautiful and warmly meaningful story . <p> Perfect ? Perhaps not , but at the very least , the end result will be perfectly yours .

To spend weeks , months , crafting a work of fiction only to have it become an afterthought in the minds of an audience mere moments after its conclusion ? Devastating . <p> But to craft something with power , something with emotion , something that lives and breathes within the hearts and minds of audiences for years to come ?

The key to achieving this lasting effect rests in the understanding of the differences between a tale and a story . <h> The Tale <p> A tale is a STATEMENTa simple linear progression from one point to another . This happened , then this happened , then there was an outcome . A tale exists with no greater sense of its self , no greater purpose beyond a simple rehashing of events .

Any screenings beyond the first become a painful process endured only by those with an affinity for the subject matter . 127 Hours captures audiences with its harrowing tale of mountain climber Aron Ralston ( James Franco ) , but does anyone make the effort to watch it more than once ? One could argue this apathy exists because of the films biographical nature , but then what about Amadeus or Hotel : Rwanda ? <p> The lack of motivation to watch a second time exists because 127 Hours does n't  try to say anything . It does n't  argue a position . The tale of what happened and how it happened becomes more important than the sum total of what happened . Entertainment supplants purpose . In short , its a tale . <h> The Story <p> A story is an ARGUMENTa carefully crafted exploration of thematic elements designed to argue that a particular approach solving problems is more or less appropriate than others .

There is something the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole host of obstacles and barriers that can lessen the effectiveness of this argument ( well-meaning studio executives , faulty sound systems , distracted audience members ) , but the overriding difference between the two is that sense of purpose . <p> In sharp contrast to the tale , a story compels subsequent viewings . This desire to see a film again and again exists because a story offers us something we cant find in real life : meaning . As depressing as it may be to consider , real life has no meaning without some greater context within which to appreciate it . Storiescomplete storiesprovide that greater context . <p> By offering an objective view into a storys events and at the same time offering a subjective view ( through the Main Character ) , a story gives audience members an experience they cant have on their own .

Both rightly claim the authority to speak story . <p> Unfortunately both look down on script consultants . <p> The Scriptnotes podcast is an enjoyable listen . Both screenwriters bring a wealth of experience and intelligence to the conversation and genuinely make you feel like you 're getting the inside scoop on what it is like to be a Hollywood screenwriter .

The experience listening to their rants is one of disappointment and frustration . Here are two people you respect and admire basically trashing the one thing you think you do well : construct stories . Blog posts , like the ones Manus and Cork published , are often a great way of dealing with the cognitive dissonance and a terrific remedy to the pressure build-up . <h> No Rules ( Here Are Some Rules ) <p> Script consultant Danny Manus post ended with this thinly veiled rant against August and Mazin : <p> Those who spout off about how THERE ARE NO RULES " but then continue to tell you exactly what to believe and think and how to act and who to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblivious . <p> He has , of course , denied specifically calling out August and Mazin , but anyone who has listened to their podcast knows otherwise . Manus has since taken down the article ( thanks to Google cache it will forever be available here ) , but the point he brings up is a good one : August and Mazin do n't  believe there are any rules except the ones they give . <p> Mazin and August are not obliviousthey simply have a different take on what rules are allowed . If it comes from someone who has worked in the industry , someone who has a couple films under their belt , someone who is well respected among his or her peers then yes , those rules count . If instead the rules come from frustrated screenwriters , narrative theorists , or unpublished writers who love discovering what makes great stories work and sharing that with othersthen those rules should be ignored . Rules from Mazin , August and Brosh McKenna are OK ; rules from Huntley , Phillips or Snyder are not . <p> The hypocrisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rules of telling stories , but then proceed to list rules within the very same podcast . Explaining how to handle " two-handers " stands out as a rule that they frequently call upon.3 Either stories have base elements to them or they do n't  . The professional status of who discovers or presents these components should not matter . As someone fascinated with the rules as presented by the Dramatica theory of story , this preference for the professionals over the insightful ones is disarming . <p> Our definition of rules may be different . Mazin and August may be rallying against the page-number set , those unique group of theorists , readers , and narrative junkies who believe Act turns happen at set page amounts . If this is the case then yes , they are right , there are no rules . But if they want to discount the thought-provoking revelation that competent stories are simply analogies to a single human mind trying to solve a problem , then they are dead wrong . There are rules.4 <p> And its OK to learn them . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> You denounce outside education , classes , advice , feedback , podcasts or knowledge from anyone other than yourself or those you have personally endorsed and deemed as worthwhile .

Arment may look down on Android developers , but he certainly is n't telling them they 're stupid for attending a JavaScript developers weekend workshop . This hostile mindset towards education seems counter-intuitive to those of us who enjoy developing our minds . <p> Consultant John Cork challenges this attitude in his two post spectacular Craig Mazin is Lying : Part One and ( Part Two .

And why should they ? <p> True , no one cares about the name of the school , but they do care what you learned there , what knowledge you gained . Mazin , I think , misinterprets Corks point about access to knowledge as claim of nepotism . <p> Having gone to CalArts in the early 90s I can tell you that I absolutely have experienced special privileges in the animation industry . Many of my classmates went on to very successful careers and have been in positions to hire me and I 've enjoyed the benefits of those classmates recognizing me . I 'm very thankful that I had an opportunity to go to that school and had a chance to make so many great friends with so many talented people.5 <p> But this was n't the point of Corks diatribe . <p> Cork calls out the access to knowledge , the means towards a higher education and one geared specifically towards writing and narrative structure . If you can find the same information , perhaps better information somewhere else ( and at a much cheaper price ) , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the one offering it a deceiver ? <h> Working to Further Better Understanding <p> Mazin inspires most when he says this : <p> Be careful , work hard , trust in your talent , be honest with yourself , and do n't  let anyone convince you that you need them to succeed . <p> But ca n't stand statements like this : <p> The truth is without paid consultants , you 'll have the same damn chance you 'll have with them . But one thing is definitely for sure : you will be poorer with them . <p> Maybe some consultants do n't  work with the intention of educating the client . I do . My site Narrative First offers hundreds of articles on story structure and analysis intended to help make better writers . My consultancy extends that thinking towards a clients specific work . How this differs from a collegial education or an established guru workshop like McKees Story class is beyond me .

Am I a charlatan if I was invited ? I admit that at times I feel like a snake-oil salesman , especially after listening to one of Mazins impassioned pleas.6 But then I receive word that an attendee of one of my workshops last year was so inspired by my class that he rallied his own local writers group to fly me out there and that all goes away . I love teaching story and revealing all the great things Dramatica says about story . <p> I understand being upset at those who promise industry insider access or the secrets to making it big in Hollywood . That does n't  seem right . I only promise to reveal the secrets of competent and effective narrativethe success is still up to the artists talent . <h> Belief in Magic <p> The Dramatica approach to developing a story is one of learning . A process of developing ones understanding of narrative structure and how great stories work . Twenty years later and I 'm still learning fascinating things about story I never knew existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they have a greater storehouse of knowledge to draw upon . How is this even something to be debated ? <p> My feeling is that Mazin , like his podcasting co-host August , participates in a form of magical thinking when it comes to writing . That the artist triumphs by summoning a mystical spirit guide or muse to show them the path , and that every achievement stems from within . That they alone possess a special ability that ca n't be taught or ca n't be analyzed . That writing is a spiritual event . <p> Dramatica is not an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of wannabe writers . In truth , its there to lift the veil on magical thinking . <h> Something New to Learn <p> Even Manus takes time out from vilifying Mazin and August to attack someone else : <p> You create your own terminology for words and concepts that do n't require new terminology ( or perhaps your own FONT because the font others use are n't good enough for you ? ) . <p> This is almost certainly a reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial evaluations of the theory and is , in its own way , another attempt at hindering education . <p> Dramatica redefines concepts like Protagonist and Main Character because it has identified the need to look at a storys problem both objectively and subjectively . The dissonance between the two creates meaning and provides the Audience with something hey cant find in real life ( the opportunity to hold big perspectives within the same context ) . <p> Huntley and Philips did n't  do this to sell software , they did it because they identified something that no one in thousands of years ever considered . Damned if they do , damned if they do n't  . If they came up with new words they would have met resistance , so they chose to improve Main Character and Protagonist.9 <p> A difficult process to be sure , but one that deepens the writers understanding of narrative . <p> Cork closes out his double fisted rant with an endorsement of peers and mentors : <p> So , aspiring screenwriters , you can take Craig Mazin 's advice , that nothing exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery , that there are no patterns . Or you can look at the careers of dozens and dozens of screenwriters and realize that no matter how much they may want to act like they simply arrived where they are , there is more to that story .

Some find them elsewhere along the way . This brave new world offers an unparalleled opportunity to connect with the smartest and brightest and a chance to grow beyond ourselves . <p> The idea of the script consultant should be one of education .

Protagonists , Heroes , Goals , Problems and Solutionssimple enough to comprehend for any writer beyond grade school , yet concepts that this theory narrowly and accurately defines . And in some cases , redefines . <h> Avoiding Problems and Pursuing Solutions <p> Every client I work with and past and present members of the Dramatica Mentorship Program gains access to the Narrative First Slack Teama private instant messaging service specifically reserved for writers interested in improving their understanding and application of the theory .

Most Auhors comprehend Goals of Obtaining because Goals are about achieving something . It is when Dramatica suggests a Goal of Impulsive Responses that some struggle .

A Problem is something to be avoided , right ? Sometimes . But that is not Dramaticas definition of a Problem . Dramatica co-creator Chris Huntley explains : <p> Some see the definition of problem as that which one wishes to avoid or prevent , and the definition of a solution as that which one pursues to resolve the problem . - That definition of problem and solution is okay though a bit inaccurate since it does not address the concept of inequity , which is the Dramatica definition . - <p> Dramaticas definition of Problem is the source of inequity in a Throughline .

Think of characters like William Wallace in Braveheart or Furiosa in Mad Max : Fury Roadboth pursued their goals driven by an inequity deep within them . Problems are not always something to be avoided . <h> Conflating Dramaticas Purpose <p> The second error of conflation arrives when one forgets the purpose of a story point . Huntley continues : <p> Even using those definitions does not identify the SOURCE/NATURE of the Problem or the SOURCE/NATURE of the Solution . - Problem and Solution are defined by WHAT they are in narrative structure , and even require further refinement when put to use by adding yet another contextual constraint , namely the throughline with which it is associate ( e.g. MC , OS , etc . ) . <p> Everyone forgets the context of the Throughline .

George McFly may have a Problem of Avoidance in Back to the Future , but from the perspective of Main Character Marty that Problem , or inequity , looks more like Hinder .

@@119272919 @8272919/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> The True Definition of a Protagonist <p> Many think they know , but the comfort of their preconceptions blinds them to the complexity of sophisticated storytelling . For thousands and thousands of years , many believed the Earth to be the center of the Universe . A lie mutually agreed upon is still a lie . <p> Earlier this year the distinction was made between the Main Character and the Protagonist . It was met with varying degrees of interest and ridicule , the latter coming as a result of perhaps a failure to adequately describe the intricacies of a story that does n't  assume both are one and the same . There can be no argument that the commonly accepted definition of the Protagonist is " who the story is about . " Whether or not this understanding is beneficial for writers hoping to create something of import is quite another . <p> Once a writer understands the difference between Main Character and Protagonist , whole worlds of possible storylines open up to them . Why should a writer be confined to stories where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading the charge ? Are n't  there aspects of life where we are n't  guiding the boat , where we are n't  the ones in control ? Do n't  those moments have meaning as well ? <p> It would be great to tell a story about an innocent man trying to escape jailfrom the perspective of another inmate who lost hope a long time ago . Wait , that 's already been donein The Shawshank Redemption . Or what about a story where a writer in East Germany tries to broadcast the plight of his peoplefrom the perspective of the man forced to spy on him . Shoot , they did that one already with The Lives of Others ( Des Leben der Anderen ) . <p> Well then , what about the story of a corporate litigator trying to maintain her companys globally friendly reputationfrom the perspective of the man held responsible for keeping that companys nefarious backroom dealings a secret . Too late . <p> Tony Gilroy already did it with his masterful film , Michael Clayton . <h> One Does n't  Imply The Other <p> The difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences eyes into the story , the Protagonist pursues the goal of the story . Sometimes they are played by the same character , as with Luke Skywalker in Star Wars or Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs . Sometimes they are not , as with the examples above of Red in Shawshank and Wiesler in The Lives of Others . They key is in understanding that the assignment of the Protagonist comes as a result of a logical assessment , not an emotional one , as is the case with the Main Character . <p> Thus , the Main Character is not always the key focus of a story.Shawshank is about Andy Dufresne and his unjust imprisonment , yet we experience the film through Reds eyes . Amadeus is about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , yet we see his wild antics through poor mediocre Salieri . A character may be the subject matter of a piece without also being the one we receive intimate personal insight into . Empathy dictates Main Character , not sympathy . <p> The Protagonist is not always the one who changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jake Gittes in Chinatown does n't  , yet each one of these characters is driven to solve their storys individual problems - the key definition of a storys Protagonist . Clarice endeavors to stop Buffalo Bill . Salieri wants to be remembered . And Jake leads the investigation to figure out what really happened all those years ago . <p> It is apparent that there too are big problems happening in Michael Clayton and that there are efforts being made to resolve them . But what is n't as straightforward is what the outcome of it all means . Discovering that requires a closer look at the meaning behind the ending of the film . <h> Bittersweet Endings <p> Without a doubt , Michael Clayton has a bittersweet ending . Even though the good guys have won , there is no Throne Room sequence like there is in Star Wars and there are n't  fighter pilots jumping up and down with glee like there are in Top Gun . This victory is much more personal . <p> And it is n't the kind of bittersweet ending one finds in films like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarice or Jake , Michael is in a much better place at the end of his story . He has resolved his issues with his family , grown closer to his estranged brothers , and , going on , one can imagine Michael will improve his superficial relationship with his son . That masterfully acted scene in the cab is proof of this emotional state of peaceit ends with a slight smile on his face , recognition that he has come through the other side a better man . <p> For a story to have that bittersweet ending there needs to be a juxtaposition between the Main Characters emotional state at the end of the film and the outcome of the headline , or main story line . That 's the very definition of bitter and sweet . In the case of Silence or Chinatown , both Main Characters are left with unresolved feelings , yet their respective cases have been solved . Jake still does n't  get it and Clarice still hears crying lambs . Michael Clayton has and therefore requires that the main story line must end in failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be <h> The Pursuit of the Goal <p> Who in Michael Clayton is most driven to get what they want ? Who is driven to pursue this goal at any cost , regardless of who must be disposed of in order to accomplish it ? <p> Karen . <p> From a purely objective context , which is where a writer must sit during the construction of a storys structure , the character who is driven to Pursue the Goal is the Protagonist . This motivation to pursue must be present within every act otherwise the story will breakdown ( as was the case in Zombieland ) . If that motivation wanes or " dies " somehow , then the story will slow down and meander aimlessly . <p> Michael Clayton does not suffer from this problem . <p> That is why Arthur can not be the Protagonist and why , by proxy , Michael himself ca n't foot the bill once his best friend finds greener pastures . Michael could care less about uNorth until 3/4 of the way through when they finally take a shot at his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he is more like the fly in the ointment rather than the one actively pursuing a clear goal from the very beginning . In this respect , he is acting more like the Antagonist , trying to prevent a negative goal from happening . <p> It is Karen who is driving the story towards the goal of having uNorth escape this lawsuit unscathed . As an audience we may find this act reprehensible , but objectivelywithout preconceptions of right or wrongit becomes clear that this is what is truly going on . This construct is what makes Michael Clayton seem so complex and why it feels more sophisticated than most of the typical Hollywood blockbusters . <p> There are no cats to save in this film . <h> Negative Goals <p> While the Goal of the story is purely an objective concept , the Authors own preconceived notions about what is right or wrong often find their way into it . This is why , for the most the part , the difference between Protagonist and Antagonist lies within who is the " good guy " and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , and the Author constructs a story where the bad guy is leading the charge to resolve the storys problem , the story is said to have a Negative Goal . <p> A Negative Goal is one many in the audience might find detestable or immoral . In Reservoir Dogs , the bad guys Mr. White ( Harvey Keitel ) et . al.work to escape from their bungled jewelry heist while simultaneously trying to identify who " the rat " is . While outside of the world of the story it may be difficult to side with vicious jewelry thieves with an affinity for ear removal , the problems that Quentin Tarantino constructed for these characters placed these crooks at the head of the charge to resolve them . They become sympathetic as we naturally root for those attempting to conquer inequity . <p> As mentioned before in the article Determining Your Protagonists Goal , the key word here is Pro-tagonist . This character is for something , this character is working towards solving the problem at hand . And because stories are about solving problems , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working diligently to solve that problem . <p> From the very beginning , Karen represents the drive to pursue in the larger context of the story . In fact , another quality of an Archetypal Protagonist , that of being driven to weigh the pros and cons of a situation , can also be applied to her . Whether it is in front of the mirror practicing her speeches or out on the street corner debating whether or not to give the " green light " for Arthurs systematic removal , Karen is the one character faced with the heavy decisions related to the storys larger problem . <p> Karens failure is what makes Michael Clayton feel bittersweet . <p> It is also helpful to note that the concept of the Protagonist does not exist in a vacuum ; there are many different aspects of a storys structure that are tied to it . In the same way that the Protagonists success or failure helps to determine the eventual outcome of a story , the kind of pressures the Protagonist faces also aids in determining the scope of a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help in identifying the limits that keep a story from wandering around pointlessly . <h> Reining In The Story <p> Arguments can go on forever if there are n't  limits placed on them . It is the same with stories . Some stories are limited by time , some by the number of options left open to the Protagonist . High Noon is an example of the first . Michael Clayton is an example of the second . Stories that meander often do n't  have this limit clearly set for the audience . This can often happen when there is confusion over who the real Protagonist is . <p> With Karen in place as the Protagonist , it becomes very clear what the options in the story are : There are only so many ways she can deal with a mad rogue attorney running around with damning evidence . She has to get rid of everyone who had contact with it ( including the attorney himself ) and destroy any proof of it before the story can come to its rightful conclusion . Once that final option has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can meet with the members of the board at that convention center and tell them confidently that everything is going to be hunky-dory . <p> This final scene would be the climax of the storythat moment in a story when the limit has been reached and the Main Character must come to a decision regarding their resolve . As the smoke from his flamed-out Mercedes recedes , Michael finally decides to call his brother for help ( something he never would have done at the beginning of the story ) and captures Karens bribe on tapeending the story . <p> If it were Michael or Arthur as the Protagonist it becomes less clear as to what the options would have been . They perhaps could have been to meet with the girl affected by uNorths products or maybe even to get the copies of the evidence out for the world to see . But these seem weak and murky , and are interpretations of what could be there rather than what is there . The limits help to solidify the story into one meaningful piece . <h> A Structural Understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding their role in the telling of a story helps to point out to a writer where they may be problems in his or her story . A majority of popular story paradigms might call for a rewrite of Michael Clayton because Michael is not a " willful protagonist " or because his " external needs " do not conflict properly with what he really " internally wants . " This advice , while well intentioned , would only lead to murkier drafts and more disappointment . <p> The story works . And the reason it works so well and seems so unique in its complexity is because , structurally , it differs from everything else out there . Predictability goes out the window as the patterns set up to establish the story are unfamiliar to those who can now download a movie to their phone in under thirty minutes . <p> Michael Claytons relatively minor box-office success could be more attributed to a lack of marketing expertise in much the same way that The Iron Giant disappeared without a trace , or how it took ten years for The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the same fate lies in wait for this Gilroy and Clooney collaboration , for if one thing is for sure , the film calls for repeated viewings which in turn , result in even greater moments of appreciation for what was accomplished . <p> Great well-told stories always have this effect on audiences . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> One of the greatest contributions to the world of storytelling comes from the Dramatica theory of story and its understanding that the concepts of Main Character and Protagonist are not one and the same . This appreciation of what is really going on in a story is one of those things that makes the theory so special . Instead of becoming a reductive mandate like so many other rules espoused by gurus and experts of story , this concept opens up so many more creative avenuesgiving the writer a chance to produce things as yet unseen . <p> As far as Michael Clayton goes the Story Outcome is a Failure and the Story Judgment is Good . Then corresponds with that " bittersweet " feeling the film has at the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite fit in here as Michael has clearly overcome his personal issues and at the end of the cab ride has found a relative place of peace . The climax is brought about by a Story Limit of Optionlock . <p> With Karen as the Protagonist ( driven by Pursuit and Consider ) , Arthur becomes the Antagonist ( Prevent and Reconsider ) , though his presence is more about trying to get others to question their actions based on new information than it is actually trying to Prevent something from happening . <p> Michaels place in the Objective Story Throughline becomes less of a slam-dunk which also speaks to the complexity of this film . This is n't Avatarthe characters within are rich and unique not only in their presentation but also within their roles structurally . Yet another reason why this film becomes one of the cherished few by fans of great storytelling .

@@119272921 @8272921/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Character Motivation Defined <p> Characters are more than the labels they are so easily defined with . <p> As explained in the previous article introducing the Dramatica Archetypes , each character is defined by their function within the main story line . Protagonists pursue goals while Guardians aid the effort towards that goal . While these quick definitions make it easy to understand their purpose in a story , they fall short of actually providing an author with the means to use these characters in a story . <p> To find those tools within the archetypes , they first must be broken down into a finer resolution . <h> The Elements of Character <p> If you want to know what motivates your character , you must move beyond the labels of Protagonist and Antagonist and look at the elements that created that label in the first place . Looking this closely at a character , we can see that there are motivations that lead to action and motivations that lead to decision making . An archetype happens when just the right action element is matched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in the same character and the labels we 've grown so familiar with will " ring out " as if striking the right harmonic chord . <p> So a Protagonist is driven to Pursue a goal ( their Action element ) while at the same time possessing the motivation to Consider ( their Decision element ) the pros and cons of attempting that goal . The Antagonist is driven to Prevent that goal and to force the characters in the story to Reconsider whether or not they should take action in the first place . Match the right Action element with the right Decision element and you get an Archetypal Character . While there may indeed be some cultural significance to these characters ( as witnessed by Jung/Campbell/Vogler ) , their real power lies in their objective reality . <p> At first glance , it may be difficult to decipher the difference between Consider and Reconsider . The former describes a character who weighs their options , makes a decision and moves on . The latter describes a character who has already made a decision , but now finds themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its difficult to make sense of at first , but once you see it at work , over time it will start to become apparent ( I promise ) . <p> In addition , its important to note that these elements do not necessarily have to be " within " the character themselves , they can be attributed to or seen as properties of that character by others within the story . The Antagonist represents the motivation to Reconsider , whether they are driven to do it themselves or whether they motivate others to Reconsider . Regardless of how it is exposed within a story , all that matters is that they represent that part of the storys larger argument . <h> Character Archetypes in Star Wars <p> You 'll find examples of each Archetype broken down by their motivation elements at the end of this article . <p> You can see how the murder of Lukes aunt and uncle is really an attempt by the Empire to get the Rebels to Reconsider their rebellious efforts . Its not so much that Mr. Tarkin is pacing back and forth deliberating whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he and his compatriots represent the motivation to Reconsider . Lucky for the galaxy , Luke decided to stick with his original Consideration . <h> Now What ? <p> But Archetypal Characters are boring , right ? For the most part , I agree . Sure , maybe one or two within a story is OK , but all eight ? Probably not a good idea nowadays ( unless you 're purposely trying to create a throwback to 20th century fiction ) . The trick is to realize that you do n't  have to match up the right Action element with the right Decision element . You can mix and match to your hearts desire . In other words , you can let your creativity take over . <p> Woody Harrelsons character in Zombieland , Tallahassee , is a unique mix of elements from the Guardian Archetype and the Contagonist Archetype . As Guardian to Jesse Einsenberg and the girls , Tallahassee represents the drive to Help the group reach the amusement park . But it would be quite a stretch to say that he also represented the other Guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is motivated by Temptation . You do n't  have to look much further than his addiction to Hostess Sno Balls for proof of that . This is what makes his character so unique and interesting . The fact that he is motivated by conflicting elements creates an interestingness factor to him that Ben Kenobi ca n't quite live up to . <p> You can even combine Archetypal Characters as they did in the original Toy Story . Woody is both the Protagonist and Reason character of the story . As Protagonist , he Pursues the goal of reuniting with Andy while also Considering the pros and cons of taking Buzz back with him . As Reason , he applies Logic ( as in the opening sequence when all the other toys are freaking out during Andys birthday party ) while at the same time maintaining Control over the group and the situation . <h> To Creativity and Beyond <p> This understanding of Character Archetypes is precisely what makes the Dramatica theory of story superior to all previous understandings of story . As opposed to the Campbell/Heros journey paradigm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex storytelling . While you can use them as is , their real power lies in their ability to easily communicate a real understanding of character motivation . In fact , once you understand the elements that make up an Archetypal Character , the only limit to character development is your own imagination .

Antagonists prevent it . Amidst this epic struggle a relationship develops between two principal characters , a relationship that reflects and balances out the more obvious fight between good guy and bad guy . To maintain this parity between big picture and bonding , Authors may find the idea of a Relationship Story Goal helpful . <p> Love stories present a challenge to writers . Buddy films like Toy Story or 48 Hours , father/son films like How to Train your Dragon or October Sky , and mentor films like The Matrix or Kung Fu Panda inherently provide rich conflict because of the nature of the relationship between the two principal characters .

Find what it is that must be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for conflict . <h> The Source of Trouble <p> Four Throughlines , four Problems . Overall Story , Main Character , Influence Character and Relationship Story . Each represents a different perspective on a storys central inequity . By showing an Audience member that what they thought was the problem actually looks like something completely different from another point-of-view , a writer can insure that what they want to say comes across without reticence . The story functions as a whole and complete argument . <p> The Problems in each Throughline well up from the base of a story and create what are known as Concerns . Luke constantly tests himself in Star Wars generating a Concern for himself that his life is n't progressing fast enough . The oppressive control by the Nazis in Casablanca fashions a Concern of obtaining Letters of Transit . Nemos headstrong refusal to see his disability as a hindrance in Finding Nemo begets a Concern of how hell be able to survive without his dad around . In each of these examples both Problem and Concern function as Static Story Points , meaning they persist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alleviating these Concerns becomes the primary focus of each Throughline . The energy directed towards their completion can make them appear as individual Goals . Nemo wanting a future he can call his own , Luke wanting to constantly move on to the next step in his own personal " evolution " these Concerns give each Throughline a point to aim for . Point of fact , the Concern for everyone in the story ( the Overall Story Concern ) serves as the actual Story Goal within the Dramatica storyform . Take a look at any storyform found in the Analysis section of the Dramatica website and you 'll find that Overall Story Concern shares the same apprecation as the Overall Story Goal . In Casablanca Nazi control leads to everyone wanting Ugartes Letters of Transit ( Story Goal : Obtaining ) but that authority also results in Renault bargaining for sexual favors and requiring that he always win at Ricksa general Concern for everyone ( Overall Story Concern : Obtaining ) . <p> While Dramatica does n't  call for a Main Character Goal or an Influence Character Goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Type level of the Dramatica Table of Story Elementsthe level at which the Concerns restapproximate what most think of as " plot " . Obtaining , the Future , Changing Ones Nature and Understanding all sound like plot-level story devices . <h> Our Greatest Concern <p> When it comes to the Relationship Story Throughline , the Concern between the two gives pause . Is it ones concern about the other ? Is it something they wish they always argue about ? No and no . The Relationship Story Concern functions exactly as the Concerns in the other Throughlines in that it marks a point for aspiration . It differs from the other Throughlines because instead of providing focus for an individual or group of individuals , the focus remains on the relationship . Yet like the other throughlines , this focus can be seen as a Goal . <p> Terry Malloy and Edie Doyle from On the Waterfront have to get their heads around how they 're going to fit together when they 're two completely different people .

The couples in both films have to figure out how they 're going to make it work , but both require a diiferent endpoint . Both generate a different Concern . <p> Terrys capacity for illegal activity creates a Concern in their relationship over conceptualizing how to make it all work out . They 're so different they ca n't wrap their heads around it . The self-obsessiveness between Theodore ( Joaquin Phoenix ) and Samantha ( Scarlett Johansson ) begets a Concern of misunderstanding of intention and purpose to their relationship . This is what their individual Concerns look like from the outside . Dive into either story and ask the individual characters whether they felt these Concerns and the answer would most likely be no . <h> Becoming Familiar with a New Perspective <p> The Dramatica storyform presents an objectified view of the Authors argument .

Looking at this story point from a more objective view alleviates the confusion that comes when we try to get into the minds of our characters and figure out what they personally are concerned with . <p> The struggle most writers encounter with Dramatica is detatchment from their own work . The fun part of writing , the reason most are writers in the first place , lies in entering into the story and becoming these differenct characters and living their different lives . Stepping back seems alien and cold and completely unintuitiveand they 're right . Objectivism provides no shelter for intuition . <p> But in order for a story to make sense , in order for it to exist without holes and without admonition , a tool like Dramatica becomes ultimately necessary .

Like the union that develops in a story between the two principal characters , Authors must find hallowed ground for both subjective and objective , for both their intuition and an objectified view like Dramatica . When it comes to the Relationship Story Concern between two lovers , focus not on what the characters themselves would be concerned with , but rather ask what is needed for this romance to work out , from an objective standpoint ? This Goal is not a goal for the characters , but rather a goalor markfor the Author to hit . Strike this balance and you 'll find yourself well on the way towards mastering narrative .

When we consider all the characters other than a Protagonist who might serve as the audiences position in a story , suddenly the concept of a hero becomes severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So the Main Character is the central character in the Main Character Throughline while the Protagonist is the central character in the Overall Story Throughline . They can , and often are , the same character but they do n't  necessarily have to be . In fact , there are many stories that do n't  follow this pattern . To Kill A Mockingbird is the example used in the theory book . Attitcus ( Gregory Peck ) is the Protagonist in the larger overall storyline surrounding the trial of Tom Robinson . Scout ( Mary Badham ) is the Main Character in the very personal storyline examining her prejudices towards " Boo " Radley . Both examine prejudice ; the former from a more cold , logical perspective , the latter from a more heartfelt , emotional perspective . <p> More recently I learned that the William H. Macy Las Vegas casino film The Cooler also does n't  follow this usual pattern . <p> In that film , Bernie Lootz ( William H. Macy ) fulfills the role of the Main Character . As the Shangri-Las resident " cooler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his mood ; his very presence can turn a hot craps table into , well , crap . This psychological effect is something that Bernie would take with him into any other story and thus becomes his greatest personal problem . It just so happens that this problem works great in a story about Las Vegas casinos . <p> The overall story in that film examines the conflict between Old Vegas and New Vegas . The young upstart Larry Sokolov ( Ron Livingston ) wants to transform the rundown Shangri-La into a major competitor for the newer casinos on the strip like the Bellagio or the Wynn . Standing in his way is Shelly Kaplow ( Alec Baldwin ) , the current manager of the Shangri-La . Shelly represents the old way of doing things and resents any attempts to " Disney-fy " his casino . <p> So where does Bernie fit into this story and why is he not the Protagonist ? <h> Tips for Identifying the Main Character <p> There are two techniques Ive learned that can be very effective for pulling the Main Characters storyline out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in writing your own story : <p> Take the Main Character out of the current story and put him or her in a completely different one . What personal problems would carry over into this new story ? <p> When writing the Overall Storyline forget your characters names and only refer to them in terms of their roles . In doing this , you 'll naturally assume an impersonal objective view of your characters , making it easier to identify how they fit into the OS . <p> Instead of writing Bernie into a story about casinos , what about making him the central character in a story about hiking Mount Everest or pretending to be a secret agent ? What would be some of the issues he would take with him into that new story ? If he was hiking as part of a larger expedition his mood might make it difficult for others to make it the top of the mountain ; some might even quit . In a secret agent story , his mood might be so powerful that his very presence would make some villains reconsider their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful when analyzing films like The Cooler . At first glance it may seem that Bernie is the Protagonist . After all , he is the one we care the most about and his goal of leaving Las Vegas does way heavily throughout the story . But when we look at Bernie in terms of his role as the " cooler , " we can see that he has little more than an ancillary effect on the main plot of what to do with the Shangri-La . He is not a prime mover of that plot - the casino manager ( Shelly ) and the young upstart ( Larry ) are . <p> The question then becomes which one is the Protagonist and which one is the Antagonist something that would probably be better answered in a separate article . For now , it is enough to say that Shelly is the Protagonist while Larry is the Antagonist . Bernie exists in the story and interacts with both , but he is not a prime mover of the plot . While Shelly and Larry do the bulk-work of the plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in " into the story itself ; he s the one we identify most personally with . <h> More on This <p> When looking at the characters in the Objective Story Throughline , identify them by the roles they play instead of their names . This keeps them at a distance , making them a lot easier to evaluate objectively . For instance , some of the characters in Shakespeares Hamlet might be the king , the queen , the ghost , the prince , the chancellor , and the chancellors daughter , while the characters in The Fugitive might be the fugitive doctor , the federal marshal , the dead wife , the one-armed man , and so on . By avoiding the characters proper names you also avoid identifying with them and confusing their personal concerns with their concerns as Objective Characters . <p> However , here 's a little trick you can use to help think of the Objective Story " objectively . " Think of what ALL the characters in your story are concerned with . What holds them together why are they even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , you identify them by their ROLE ( heroine , villain , father , doctor , sister , etc . ) . Avoid using their proper names . Once you think about a character in terms of their name its very difficult to avoid personalizing your feelings about them . <p> Main Character is really a point of view . It just means the player through whom the audience experiences the story first hand , as if it were happening to them . That " player " that contains the Main Character could also contain the Protagonist , or the Antagonist , Sidekick , or any archetypal or non-archetypal objective character . Keep in mind that while MC is just a point of view , a position of the audience , as it were , the objective characters are defined by their dramatic function in the plot . Just like looking at a battle from a hill , you see the soldiers not by looking through their eyes , but by the job they are doing .

Placing themselves within the heads of their characters , they look out and ask What is my greatest concern ? While seemingly effective , their greatest concern should be trying to answer of question of development from a purely subjective view . <h> Screenwriting Within the University System <p> The methods taught on this site and those based on a Dramatica approach to narrative bump up against what one finds at a university . Firmly planted within the story , tenured professors and adjunct teachers rally against this alien visitor from another dimension . While teaching story at the California Institute of the Arts , I often heard of other teachers downplaying or outright challenging the Dramatica theory of story . <p> Why is it then that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ive been struggling against a number of instructors recentlyThey kept pushing and pushing , indicating that I was failing to grasp how to create a compelling protagonist because my main character does not changeThen I read your articles about the Changed vs . Steadfast protagonistand it all makes so much more sense now why I could n't see a problem with what I was doing . <p> Students find kinship because Dramatica singles out the blind spot in the university approach : subjectivity . So focused on what a character feels and sees and wants and needs , these approaches to story fail to see what the story wants and needs . Subjectivity , by definition , fails to see the entire picturethe picture an Author needs to write a complete story . <p> But you need both . <p> Objectivity lacks passion and stories require feeling and fierceness if they hope to connect with an Audience . Dramatica and the more popular subjective approaches to structuring a story like the Heros Journey or Save the Cat ! work in tandemnot in opposition . The former informs the objective view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both methods simultaneously guarantees greater competency . <h> The Sequence Method <p> The Sequence Method , a particularly subjective approach made popular by Paul Gulino and used extensively at major universities , relies on Dramatic Questions to help set the tone of each major movement on a narrative . While many simply focus on the " Major Dramatic Question " of the entire story , the Sequence Method encourages writers to ask questions for each individual Act and eventually each Sequence and Scene . By doing so , writers secure tension within their Audience . <h> Finding the Subjective within the Objective <p> Our article Finding the Major Dramatic Question of Your Story showcases a process for converting Dramaticas rather " abstract " and objective view of a storys structure into the subjective view of story . By looking at the Story Goal from the point-of-view of the characters , an Author can easily identify what many refer to as the " Central " Dramatic Question . <p> This process works great for generating an overall sense of where the characters find their focus , but when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves the end result proves less than beneficial . Does one constantly refer to this same question in each and every scene ? And if so , how can you possibly sustain interest ? <p> Thankfully , Dramatica provides an effective solution . <h> The Easy Plot Points <p> Everyone gets the Story Goalwhether the end result of a want or external purpose , the concept of characters striving for some resolution resonates clearly . So too , the Story Consequence . For those concerned with finding the " stakes " of a particular narrative , the Story Consequence offers a concrete focal point for failure in the Overall Story . <p> It should come as no surprise to those in Hollywood that Dramatica sees the failure to stop or defeat a " bad guy " as an instance of dire transformation . Fail to achieve victory and face the Consequence of Changing the Worldmore often than not , for the worse.1 This is why every studio executive wants the world to be " at stake " for their tent pole featuresits the low-hanging Consequence for stories with Goals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goal within the story prove more illusive . <h> The Steps Towards Resolution <p> When I first set out to learn Dramaticaand I mean really learn DramaticaI created all kinds of charts and graphs to give my mind a better visual representation of the complex story points offered by the theory . While the original Dramatica theory book proved perceptive and inspiring , some of the terminology required greater insight . As an animator , director , and storyboard artist I find greater understanding and comprehension comes with a well positioned and articulated graphic . <p> Dramatica offers six Static Plot Points in addition to the foundational Story Goal and Story Consequence : <p> The Goal sits on top as it represents the focal point of everything . Beneath it are the Requirements as they are the steps towards reaching the Goal . The Prerequisites and the Preconditions sit directly beneath the Requirement as they are essential for those Requirements to be met . <p> For the purposes of this article , we will focus on the first two : the Story Requirements and the Story Prerequisites . <h> Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Fractal Model of Story Structure we show how the relationship between structural elements at the largest resolution cascade down into the smallest resolution . Sequences function as mini-Acts within Acts , Scenes operate as miniature Acts within the mini-Acts of Sequences within the larger more obvious Acts . With the hologram of meaningful relationships contained within the Dramatica storyform , writers can dial in the appropriate resolution for the task at hand . <p> Understanding the relationship between the Story Goal , Story Requirements , and Story Prerequisities with the aide of visuals similar to the one above , Authors can assume the position of their characters and look out to find touch points for tension . Quite simply : <p> 1 . Use the Story Requirements to generate the Dramatic Question of your second Act . <p> 2 . Use the Story Prerequisites to create the Dramatic Question of your first Act . <p> These two rules offer a simple , yet powerful approach towards using the Static Plot Points provided by Dramatica .

So why not assign the Requirements to the second major movement and the Prerequisites to the first ? The fractal relationship inherent in the model guarantees that this approach will work . <h> Our First Foray into this Approach <p> Pretend , for a moment , that you 're M. Night Shyamalan and you 're writing this cool idea for a story called The Sixth Sense . You know that the Story Goal in that film will be Understanding What Is Wrong With Cole ( Haley Joel Osment ) . Strange things will happen in and around the poor kid and no one will quite understand what is really going on .

In return for your time and careful consideration , Dramatica offers you back these thematically consistent story points : <p> With your newfound appreciation of how to incorporate these plot points into your story , you begin with the Prerequisite . While driven by the bigger question of understanding this disturbed kid , the Audience initially experiences tension in the story by wondering Will Malcom get the idea that there is something more going on here than the usual diagnosis ? <p> Perfect .

And now you have ideas for the scenes with the tape recorder , the visit to the funeral , and the accident at the side of the road . <p> And it is only once Malcom finally learns the true extent of Coles ability that he is able to finally really understand why the sullen kid entered his life . <h> Intentional Tension <p> Dramatic tension is not random and it is not happenstance . It flows naturally from the combination of story points carefully laid out to deliver a message of purposeor Authors Intentto an Audience .

It just means the player through whom the audience experiences the story first hand , as if it were happening to them . That " player " that contains the Main Character could also contain the Protagonist , or the Antagonist , Sidekick , or any archetypal or non-archetypal objective character . Keep in mind that while MC is just a point of view , a position of the audience , as it were , the objective characters are defined by their dramatic function in the plot . Just like looking at a battle from a hill , you see the soldiers not by looking through their eyes , but by the job they are doing .

Read two or three reputable reviews of Gravity and you 'll pick up on a pattern though : high praise for the spectacle , yet somehow lacking in the character department .

One possible explanation exists , an explanation that has everything to do with the integrity that comes with a solid story structure . <p> What discussion of story structure could be considered complete without a chart ? Those attracted to such devicesstructuralists love order and pounce on every opportunity to see storytelling delineated into clearly defined boxes . Luckily , the Dramatica theory of story structure ( narrative science ) has the ultimate chart for these crazed lunatics : <p> Impressive yes ? This Table of Story Elements breaks the individual pieces of narrative down into separate and distinct families of elements . At first glance it seems to be simply a collection of familiar and not-so-familiar terms , but look what happens when one pulls back and shifts the point-of-view ever so-slightly : <p> From this angle one can see that the Dramatica Table of Story Elements exists as a 3-D model of story-structure ! More than simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story frames a complete model of human psychology by breaking down narrative into four distinct levelsCharacter , Plot , Theme and Genre . This chart does more than define a storyit is story . <p> But stories are monumental things and to build something as full and robust as a great classical narrative one has to reach ever higher and higher . Only one catch . Anyone who has ever sat down with a bucket of Legos and a 6-year old eventually reaches that point where they cant build the tower any higher without risking collapse . Multiply this by four and the need for a solid foundation and perhaps even some interlocking " bridges " becomes all too clear . <p> So what is that keeps these towers of psychological structure from toppling over ? <h> Character <p> Looking at the very bottom level of the structure one finds the various elements of character found in every great story . Temptation , Chaos , Proaction and Expectation represent just a small portion of the 64 individual " traits " that can be combined and mixed to create character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of 64 elements repeats itself within each toweralbeit with slightly different arrangements . This falls in line with the theory as each " tower " really acts like a lens focused on the same thingnamely , the storys central problem .

In other words , theyll see the storys central problem as being the same thing . Likewise 2-3 of them will see the Symptom and Response to those problems as being the same .

A Main Character dealing with issues of Preconception ( in the Situation tower ) might find their critical flaw in his or her Approach ( located in the Activity tower ) . Likewise a Relationship with deep Commitment issues ( the Manipulation tower ) might find doing what is best for others ( Morality , again in the Activity tower ) a real downer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections and similar thematic tissue insure that these towers of structure wont topple into one another . <p> From here on up the connections become looser and less entangled .

Past , Progress , Doing , Obtainingall different elements of plot that define the type of narrative conflict found in each and every Act . <p> They also help guide the audiences attention in the right direction . In order for a story to " hold together " , the major Concernor area of focusfor each Throughline must be centered in the same quadrant for each story . In other words , if one Throughline finds itself concerned with Obtaining , then the other Throughlines must have Concerns of The Future , Innermost Desires and Changing One 's Nature .

They begin to show the signs of individuality one would find in broadening the scope of the viewport . Similarities appear because of the consistent focal point , but they do n't  involve thematic or elemental material from another tower . <h> Genre <p> Upon reaching the zenith of each story structure tower , one finds the four basic ways of categorizing ( or seeing ) conflict . No matter what the source of trouble for characters in a story , conflict must always fall in either a Situation , an Activity , a Way of Thinking ( or Manipulation ) or a Fixed Attitude . Its impossible to define conflict any other way . <p> But you 'll notice how broad and general these terms are when compared to the specifics found in the lower levels .

Here the towers connect through their relationships to one another , thus creating a holistic model out of something that on the surface appears strictly logical . While not as tangled and intertwined as the base , this highest level of story structure works to maintain the integrity of the mechanism as a whole . <h> Solid Construction <p> Understanding the connective tissue between these towers helps one to better appreciate the complexity of a solid and complete story .

Sure , we might witness the birth of our own child or watch with bated breath as a satellite a billion miles away navigates its way through the rings of Saturn . But what about story ? <p> If there is one quality that propels the Dramatica theory of story above all other paradigms it is that it can predict certain parts of a story . The program is smart enough to take the choices an Author makes about what it is they want to say with their story and give back to them parts of their story they had n't  even considered . The effect is pure magic . Things unknown about a story become known , revealing parts essential for the story to feel full , complete and meaningful . <p> Kurt Vonnegut , the writer behind Slaughterhouse Five , may have taken issue with computers and their efforts at " graphing " storytelling , but chances are he never had a chance to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably would have hated its accuracy in predicting some of the choices he made . How could a computer possibly mimic the intellect of a great writer ? His disdain for such applications may have inhibited the wheels of progress for some time , but then , bruised egos often cant help themselves . <p> We are learning at an exponential rate how our minds work . The Dramatica theory of story is simply one aspect of that research and a fascinating insight into why some stories work better than others . The best way to witness this uncanny feature or predictability in action is to answer the programs questions about a great story that already works , and see if what the application predicts fits the work in question . <h> Steadfast Characters and Their Problem <p> Before diving into the specific examples , it becomes important to understand the nature of a Steadfast Character and the Problem at the core of their Throughline . With Change characters , the Problem works as expected : it identifies the source of trouble in their life and the matching Solution signifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Solution never comes fully into play ( it will in small doses throughout a balanced story , but never like the Change character ) , their Problem will appear to be more like the source of their drive rather than a true problem . It will define them , almost like a core characteristic . By looking at the Steadfast characters Problem within these examples , one can get a sense of Dramaticas magical ability to predict elements of a story . <h> What is a Storyform ? <p> For those unfamiliar with Dramatica , a storyform describes the unique collection of thematic dynamics and story points that communicate the meaning of a story . In the present incarnation of the program , there are 32,768 possible storyforms . The process of storyforming needs an Author to make structural choices about their work in order to narrow down that broad number to the one unique set of appreciations that matches what it is they want to say . <p> When analyzing a work through Dramatica , the analyst tries to discover the one storyform that best matches the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , slowly working their way to the less obvious until they get down to the one storyform . When that happens the storyform will magically " sing " , predicting story points and thematic elements that the analyst did not provide . That 's the moment when the analyst knows they 've hit upon the right one . <p> The Overall Story , with its chases and space battles , fits nicely in the Domain of Activity , as does Kirks personal Main Character Domain of Situation ( the neer-do-well son of a hero ) . This forces Spocks Influence Character Domain into Fixed Attitudeand our first glimpse at the magic in action . Fixed Attitude describes Spocks Throughline perfectly : a Vulcan fixated on the rational . The Relationship between the two falls into Psychology , meaning their battleground centers around conflicting ways of thinking . Once againmagic . A perfect way to describe the conflict in their contentious relationship . They each have different ways of thinking how best to solve the problem at hand , both trying to manipulate the other into seeing things their way . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story Concern must be Obtaining , particularly in a story about revenge , but beyond that is the story exploring an Issue of Self-Interest , Morality , Approach or Attitude ? Perhaps Spocks Throughline would offer an easier way into the storyform . <p> Stepping down into the Fixed Attitude Domain and a Concern of Subconscious ( what drives him ! ) we find four groups of four elements each . Scanning the four for the best grouping , the quad below Hope sings out the name Spock : Logic , Feeling , Control and Uncontrolled . If ever there was a group that described what problems a Vulcan goes through , this would be it ! <p> The question now becomes , which one is his Problem ? What is the true source of his inequity ? Its clear that he believes his emotions get the best of him , a Symptom of Feeling seems to be the best choice as the Symptom describes what a character thinks their problem is . <p> And with that , were down to one storyform . And here is where the magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncontrolled and his Solution as Control . Think to his fistfights with the young Vulcans earlier on in the film for an example of his Problem , and his ability to control his emotions at the end for proof of his Solution . Hopping up to the Overall Story we see that the program has identified Uncontrolled as the Overall Story Problem as well ( Nero anyone ? ) with Avoidance as the Symptom ( warp-holing to prevent things from happening ) and Pursuit as the Response ( pursuing Nero to the ends of the universe ) . So far so good . <p> But the greatest instance of magic , the one that solidly identifies this particular storyform as being the one , is in Kirks Domain . Based on the choices made , Dramatica predicts that Kirks Problem would be Oppose . How could one possibly find a better term to describe him in this story ? Not only does this trait show up in the opening scene where he borrows his step-dads car , but also in every other scene where someone tells Kirk he cant do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ( MC Response - Pursuitmore magic ! ) . <p> Without any tampering from the analyst , Dramatica has accurately predicted the types of thematic elements that would make Star Trek work as a solid story . If one were looking to write this story within the first couple months of development , a simple adherence to the suggestions made by the program would help guarantee the final product would mean something - that everything would together in a seamless holistic piece . <p> But what about something a little less popcorn-predictable ? Maybe something more scholarly , more character-driven ? <h> Jane Eyre <p> No way a computer program can predict the intricacies of Charlotte Bront+s 1847 novel , right ? Well , if you plug in Janes obvious Resolve of Change , her Approach as a Do-er , her Holistic Problem Solving Style ( how else to explain her new home in the middle of nowhere ? ) , and the Story Dynamics of Decision , Optionlock , Success and Good , the storyform begins to take shape . <p> Add to this an Overall Story clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters who have designs on Jane ) and an Overall Concern of Becoming ( again , manipulating Jane to become what they want ) and the program has narrowed down the possible storyforms to 16 . One of those sixteen elements must be the Overall Story Problem - the problem plaguing everyone within the story . As with the analysis of Spock , we group the four quads of four as a group in order to figure out which set feels more like the source of trouble within the story . Realizing that everyone creates trouble for themselves when they act from a sense of Obligation , an analyst could easily see how Logic , Feeling , Help and Hinder " sing " the nature of difficulty within this story . In fact , doing what is sensible ( Logic ) screams out as the actual Problem , particularly in light of Janes final decision to go with her emotions instead ( Feeling ) . <p> But where is the magic ? <p> Hop on over to Rochesters Influence Character Domain ( Fixed Attitude - how about that for starters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted his Problem to be Conscience . How else would you describe a man who cares for a wife who so clearly belongs in a mental institution ? Is that not doing the right thing , rather than taking the easy way out ? Amazing , right ? A computer program has accurately predicted the choices a mid-19th century author made during the writing of her novel . <p> Magic . Pure and simple . <h> The Enduring Model of the Mind <p> The reason Bront+s novel has lasted for nearly 200 years and the reason why people still feel compelled to retell that story is because it based its narrative on a solid storyform . Storyforms are simply models of human psychologya snapshot of the human mind at work trying to solve a problem . Audiences recognize this fact and appreciate the care given to a story that thinks the way they do . They feel drawn to stories that have something meaningful to say . <p> So does one need this program in order to create something as powerful and lasting as Jane Eyre ?

The software is an invention based on the discovery . <p> These principles of story structure were there long before the invention of the computer and the programs that followed it .

In the aughts it was Blake Snyder and McKee yet again . What do the teens , the 20s and beyond hold in store for writers ? <p> McKee , the most well thought-out of the bunch , may last another decade or so . Snyder too may survive , though without his personal touch , a decline in interest will probably occur . <p> But if there is to be any hope for the future of storytelling though , the Dramatica theory of story should take center stage . Based on the fundamental concept that a story is analogous to a single human mind trying to solve a problem , this story theory cogently explains why stories exist and why some are better than others . It is the most advanced , most complete model of storytelling available to us today . <p> The previous paradigms do n't  even come close . <h> Bill Did n't  Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Dramatica goes a little something like this : <p> Its too complicatedmakes you wonder how Shakespeare was able to write all those great plays without it ! LOL <p> And not just Shakespeare . Theyll cite Casablanca or To Kill A Mockingbird . Basically , insert any classic writers name or great story into the above straw man argument and you 'll have the basis for why so many people give up on learning this theory . But the above is less of an argument and more of a maska mask used to shield an insecure mind from facing anything more challenging than " Fun and Games " or " progressive complications " . <p> In addition to exemplifying an error in critical thinking , this snarky half-witted comment fails to take into account the radical changes between this century and those that proceeded it . <h> The Reality of Today <p> Writers in 2010 are constantly bombarded by a multitude of inputs .

Creativity occurs when the mind forgets and replaces that space with new material from which to build even more networked ideas upon . If anything , this new world order of distraction leads to greater and more original works of art . More random inputs naturally lead to more spontaneous connections . Damming the flow would only stifle potential greatness . <p> Of course the danger is that in allowing chaos to run the show , authors risk writing something with no ultimate point to it , no message . Spontanaeity in the moment is great , but quickly turns into an unwanted bedfellow if the purpose of ones work is to establish some greater meaning . These random pieces must be connected thematically . <p> Furthermore , it is silly to think that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social networking tools .

You need to know how to communicate to everyone by engaging in the culture growing and developing around you . <p> Thankfully , Dramatica can manage this chaos . <h> Dealing with Distraction <p> Dramatica gives you the tools necessary to deal with this new world . In short , the theory helps you define what the message of your story is and then , makes sure that you keep that message consistent throughout your piece . It sets the purpose behind your work of fiction in stone . <p> In this way , you can still keep up on what your sister had for lunch through her Facebook updates , while simultaneously making sure that all the characters in your story maintain the thematic issue that selfishness leads to disaster ( or whatever the thematics behind your message call for ) . Why is this important ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that her tuna sandwich might inspire your Main Characters backstory to center around a desire to stop destructive over-fishing .

Why shut this possible source of inspiration off ? <p> Dramatica allows the chaos to seep in , but is always there to constantly remind you what it is you wanted to say . By setting the story engine into place , you are capturing your intent in digital form . As a steadfast writing partner , Dramatica will ensure that you remain honest to the meaning you hope to communicate . <p> But does n't  a work of art ebb and flow and change purpose as it is developed ? Some do , and when that happens you can rework Dramaticas story engine to incorporate your changes .

Thirty minutes . <p> Its safe to say that Shakespeare had a bit more . <p> With Dramatica , you sit down for those thirty minutes and instantly step back into the message of your story . Because it is so accurate and it because it maintains an unwavering consistency , it frees you to concentrate on writing the story you intended to write instead of wasting time remembering what it was you were trying to say . <p> Knowing that your intent will remain intact , you can let your mind wander and soak up all that happens around you .

Those who use this line of logic to argue against using the theory might as well argue that we should stop using computers for basic word-processing because Shakespeare used a pen . Extending it further , we should stop self-publishing on blogs or manufacturing digital content because the greats did n't  have access to these same electronic tools . <p> What a ridiculous notion . <p> Why not use the latest and greatest ? We have the ability now to write complete stories the like of which the world has never seen . Hamlet and The Great Gatsby were only the beginning .

If Melanie says so , it has to be true ! <p> With all due respect , this notion of Bond as Antagonist only confuses those new to the theory . I remember years ago , when I was first introduced to Dramatica , that I loved this idea of Bond as Antagonist .

There should always be some universal problem that affects everyone as this not only ties everyone together , but also insures that the authors message is clear and definite . If your story does n't  have this Story Goal , it might help to step further back and learn about Writing Complete Stories . <p> In The Terminator , problems exist because a naked killing machine has been sent back in time to murder Sarah Connor ( Linda Hamilton ) .

He has his own control issues to deal with and overcoming those would be his personal goal , but as far as all the other characters are concerned reaching the safety of the park is everything . <p> The problem with the story , though , is that the girls are really weak Protagonists . This is why , when they reach a certain celebritys house near the end of the 2nd act , everything in the story comes to a grinding halt .

Yet , the very nature of that goal evades such simplicity . <p> In the first and second articles of this series , goals born of problematic activities took center stage . Whether it was stopping police corruption in L.A Confidential or getting the word out about the East German suicide rate in The Lives of Others , resolution in those stories required some form of doing , obtaining , learning or understanding . Problematic activities brought forth goals of activity . <p> But what of stories where the simple act of doing is n't enough ? What of stories bred from a completely different kind of external problem ? <h> Problems and their solutions <p> What class of problem begins with the Inciting Incident of a story ?

These rogue cogs needed to be reigned in , or the cogs needed to find a way to act even more out-of-control .

It is the message and the purpose beneath the various levels of character , plot , theme and genre . It makes possible the transmission of bias . The story form is Authors intent .

At first glance , it seems as if it is supposed to be Andy as the most emotional scenes involve the college freshman-to-be and his cowboy toy .

Characters grow and develop throughout Hell or High Water , but they all grow into their resolve with neither of them growing out . <p> It would appear that Pines Toby Howard is the Main Character Throughline of the narrative as he is the only one we come to know personally . Unfortunate circumstances left him unable to pay child support to his ex-wife and out of shame , kept him from seeing his two sons for over a year . These are deep personal issues that Toby would take with him into any narrativeclear indications of Main Character Throughline material . <p> Tobys brother Tanner would seem to be the natural choice for Influence CharacterToby is more conservative and introverted when it comes to robbing banks , Tanner is more out-going and impulsive . However when it comes to their perspective on Texas and how to survive , they 're both on the same page . They may be at odds objectively , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their conflict exists in their roles as Protagonist and Contagonist , not as Main Character and potential Influence Character . <p> The only other option for Influence Character is Bridges Texas Ranger , Marcus Hamilton . At 70 years old , Marcus continues to cling onto a vision of the old West that no longer exists . In Hamiltons mind , fellow Ranger Alberto Parker ( Gil Birmingham ) is Tonto to his Lone Ranger . Racist jocularity and old-fashioned intuition are relics of the past , relics Hamilton ca n't bring himself to release . <p> One would assume that this is the great subjective debate going on in the narrative of Hell or High Water : the fight between Hamiltons vision of the old West and Tanner and Tobys reality of the new West . Old fashioned justice vs. do whatever you need to survive . Yet they never meet throughout ; the Relationship Story Throughline that should be there between them to help support the argument between these two competing points-of-view fails to materialize . <p> Adding insult to injury is the final scene on Tobys front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior worked towards . And the tension is there . And the acting is there . And we do n't  know who will end up changing their paradigm . We know Hamilton wants to pull his pistol out and go out in a blaze of glory before he has to witness the death of Texas from his own front porch . But we also know Hamilton killed Tanner , an act that may be enough to turn Toby into an impulsive criminal like his brother . The two stare intently into each others eyes , hands on triggers , calling to mind the end of every great Western <p> and then Mom shows up in her SUV . <p> In one of the most disappointing Deus Ex Machina scenes in recent years , Tobys ex-wife and sons exit the truck , introduce themselves to Hamilton , and walk insideeffectively destroying any meaningful outcome from the days events . Does Hamilton leave unavenged because he is finally ready to accept the end of it all ? Or did he leave because Mom showed up and ruined everything ? <p> Well never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that time when Jenny told Forrest she 's sorryafter she finds out she has AIDS from having all her fun . There is no emotional significance if a character changes because they have to . Its not like Hamilton is going to blow Toby away in front of the mans kidshe is n't that kind of person . So we never know exactly why the Ranger does what he does . The film cheats us out of any significant meaning . <p> Hamilton rises , bids his goodbyes , and then leaves . Both men promising theyll see each other again , tagging their conversation with " unless I see you first " a phrase that seemingly says a lot , but really says nothing . <p> Toby remained steadfast by not losing it the way his brother would ; Hamilton remained steadfast by promising to be a factor in Tobys life . With no Changed character in sight , the narrative breaks down . We do n't  know which approach was more appropriate or why the film ended the way it did . We just know Bridges is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films in the " new " Hollywood over-promises and under-delivers . The trailer is remarkable in making the film look deeper than it truly is , and should be held up as a shining example of what a studio should do to help sell a film with a deficient story . <p> See the film for the performances and the raw reality of the situation . Be prepared , however , to be disappointed as you try to understand what it all meant . Dysfunctional narratives , by their very definition , fail to add up to something more than their individual parts .

Audience empathy correlates with interest and can be used to determine who will show up at the box office . Linear/Timelock stories bring in the Male Audience members ( Armageddon , 48 Hours , 3:10 to Yuma ) and Holistic/Optionlock stories are often referred to as " chick flicks " ( Moulin Rouge ! , Splendor in the Grass and Pride and Prejudice ) .

She was so busy balancing out the most important relationship in her life throughout all these years that she failed to take time to do those things that truly make her happy . Like playing the piano . <p> In a way , the filmmakers of 45 Years used this dynamic of the Holistic thinker in a Timelock to act as a sort of meta-analysis of her life . So unprepared for this moment was she , that Kate had no other alternative than to play into her own Personal Tragedy . <h> Main Character Throughline <p> As someone who prefers to adapt herself to the problems around her rather than solve them externally , Kate finds conflict in her husbands obsession with his past love ( Main Character Approach : Be-er , Main Character Domain : Fixed Attitude , Influence Character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoid of photographs and a life without children , she becomes increasingly aware that what she thought she had she never did ( Main Character Issue : Evidence , Main Character Symptom : Self-Aware , Main Character Response : Aware ) .

With the amount of information and different perspectives available to Audiences today , a simplified beginning-middle-end approach simply does n't  cut it anymore . <p> Complete stories consist of four major movements , not three . Sure , it seems simple enough to assume that because a story has a beginning , middle , and end that there must be three movements to define these sections . But is that all there is to an Act ? A superficial take on the events within a story based upon their moment in time ? <p> Perhaps there could be something more there , something more closely related to the thematic substance buried deep within the story itself . <h> 2A , 2B or Not 2A , 2B <p> Unlike Hamlet , the answer presents itself clearly . <p> The standard in modern screenwriting paradigm calls for splitting up the Second Act into two halves , labeling them 2A and 2B . For all intents and purposes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention , there is n't anything about this approach that could prevent the successful conclusion of a film . The question becomes if the final product finishes with a glorious and well-celebrated run or peters out over the first weekend , adding weight to the already great discarded landfill of pointless stories . <p> How to avoid this unfortunate result ? <p> Do n't  assume that both halves are dealing with the same thematic stuff . Do n't  assume that this " Special World " somehow carries with it some intrinsic meaning because of its position between the beginning and the end . <p> Because it does n't  . <h> Why the Act ? <p> In a recent article on The Myth of the Three-Act Structure film critic Hulk defines the true end of an Act as something that creates propulsion , something that changes narrative value and has the characters moving towards some new reality/situation ( loosely translated from the Hulkspeakyoure welcome ) . <p> This is good stuff . <p> But something more important lies further down . Diving even deeper into what that new reality or situation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift in focusa different context from which to appreciate the central problem of a story . <h> Examining All Sides of an Issue <p> One mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter . This familiar understanding offers an excellent starting point for any discussion surrounding the thematic makeup of Acts within a story . <p> A story begins with the creation of an inequitya problem needing resolution . If one were to simply follow one perspective , one point-of-view on how to solve the issue at hand , one would simply see the terrorist . Great stories , and the Authors who write them , take in all the different ways of looking at a problem . Using the different perspectives offered both objectively in the main plot and subjectively within the Main Character , these Authors offer a greater understanding of the conflict in question . <p> But its not enough to simply include those different points-of-view , they must be laser-focused on what that problem truly is . One perspective will see the problem as an activity . Another will see it as a situation . Another a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet another will see it as a problem of psychology . Together , these perspectives unite to offer that better understanding , that appreciation of who is the terrorist and who is the freedom fighter . <h> Four Sides to Every Problem <p> With the individual perspectives defined , the attention shifts towards how each will explore their own take on the problem at hand . Take for instance the perspective of the problem as an activity . There are four separate areas an activity can fall into . Obtaining something , like a map or a new country . Doing something , like swimming the English Channel or writing a dissertation . It can fall under the category of Understanding , like appreciating the motives of a serial killer or why an alien race fights for survival . And finally , an activity find definition in Learninggathering information or educating the next generation of lion hunters . Regardless of what that problematic activity is , it will always fall into one of those four categories . One can not think of an activity that does not fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Act is to explore one of these four areas . Once it has been significantly examined , that perspective shifts into the next area and a new Act begins . When speaking of changing " narrative value " , these are concrete occurrences of what that value truly is . Once a new area , or Act , has been thoroughly exhausted ( that feeling of " we get it already " ) , the next one takes over . This is why there is that sensation that the characters can not go backthey wont because theyve already covered that area . <p> Four areas for each perspective . Four acts per story . <p> Any more Acts would simply be a rehash of a old contexts . That 's why stories end when they do . All sides , all contexts explored . <p> How to Train Your Dragon begins with the dragons and Vikings at odds with another , one side stealing and the other side hunting ( Doing ) .

Nothing more to cover , all perspectives of an activity examined . <p> Same with The Terminator . Problems begin when a robot from the future arrives and mistakingly shoots the wrong Sarah Connor ( Understanding ) . These misunderstandings persist ( trust the police , trust the scary guy in the overcoat ? ) until Sarah has no other choice but to take Kyle at his word . From there its a race to see how quickly Kyle can convince Sarah of her importance and the reality of their situation ( Learning ) . The second half of the film focuses on the chasebeginning with the shootout at the police station and ending with the destruction of the Terminator ( Doing and then Obtaining ) . It almost feels like one Act because Doing and Obtaining are so closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift from the running away ( Doing ) to the purposeful effort to destroy ( Obtaining ) . That final movement becomes essential in a story exploring problems of activity . Leave that final Act out and the story would feel incomplete . The reason the story works rests in the fact that the Author explored all sides . Sarah rises to the occasion and defeats the robot menace once and for all . <h> Why the Need for an Act <p> There may be some who see more Acts within a storysome say five , some say twenty , some forty-twobut most likely what they are seeing is something other than the true function of an Act . When seen within the context of a well-balanced argument , the reason why Acts exist becomes clear . Regardless of how an Author decides to divvy up their work , psychologically speaking the story can only function as the result of four movements . <p> Four acts .

Of course , even Amelie herself ca n't avoid a happy ending as she scooters her way through the streets of Paris , hugging her new-found love . <p> Personally , the reason I love this clip so much is the way in which Jean-Pierre Jeunet visually reveals this kind of ending with the kinetic camera work , i.e. using the medium to describe the emotion . Awesome . <p> Lastly , we have the bawdy South Park movie . Satan is sent back to Hell , thus reverting the quaint Colorado town back to its idyllic roots .

A staunch and steadfast supporter , Morpheus is always there , refusing to back down from the notion that Mr. Andersen is the chosen one . This rigid attitude is enough to challenge Mr. Andersen to reevaluate how stuck he is . <p> Can this definition also apply to Kyle ? No . He certainly refuses to back down from the idea that Sarah is the future leader , but it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact the he really is from the future ! If it was Morpheus in there instead telling Sarah to free her mind , she would have laughed and told the bespectacled one that she is already hard at work on that .

" <h> The Direction of Character Development <p> In addition to suffering different kinds of problems , including influences from different forces challenging them to change , both Sarah and Neo grew in completely different directions . <p> Before Neo could stare down those flying bullets , he needed to get over the back-and-forth , am-I-or-arent-I the One conversation that dominated his every thought . His visit to see the Oracle was n't about fate and whether he was going to knock that vase over , instead it was an opportunity for him to set clear in his mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally see his skepticism for what it truly wassomething that was holding him back . <p> Before Sarah could make that Terminator pancake she needed to begin taking the initiative .

" That wasnt simply a tense action sequence , that was an opportunity for Sarah to witness the positive results of taking action . Only then could she lead the legless stalker into the hydraulic press and slam that red button down . And only then could she take the initiative to finally run from her problems . <h> Emotional State at the End of a Story <p> And finally , the greatest difference between these two " heroes " exists in their emotional standing at the end of their story . At the end of The Matrix Neo walks confidently amongst the great unwashed , a slight smile on his face , acknowledging to us and to himself that he is over that feeling of separateness he once felt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sarah at the end of The Terminator and that distant look on her face captured forever in the Polaroid snapshot .

" <p> She was thinking that things are n't  better for her , regardless of the love she found . The weight of her new role weighs heavily on her and only supplants the angst she began the film with . <p> Compared to The Matrix and its all-out triumphant ending , The Terminator is a story of Personal Tragedy . They stopped the killing machine , but only with great emotional costs paid primarily by the storys Main Character . Like Unforgiven , The Silence of the Lambs , District 9 and The Prestige , The Terminator leaves its central character over-burdened with a heavy does of angst . <p> Just another reason why Sarah Connor is dramatically different from Neo . <h> The Proof Is in the Problem <p> Neo had to free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother of the Future .

Sarah headed South , both physically and emotionally . <p> No matter how one slices it , the true problems affecting Neo and Sarah couldnt be more different . Beyond their similar discussions involving fate and following ones destiny , these characters face inequities that find their place in worlds far more disparate than simply " Old " and " Special " . When faced with characters at polar ends of the dramatic spectrum , it becomes difficult to maintain the assertion that the Heros Journey , or any other aberration , is an accurate and compelling understanding of the real fabric of a story . <p> Neo and Sarah Connor are different because their storiesthe structures of their storiesare radically different . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Within the context of Dramatica , the differences between Sarah and Neo couldnt be more clear .

When one is internally fixed , it demands an externally fixed viewpoint to break one free . <p> Because both stories have Overall Throughlines in Activity , one will have a Main Character Growth of Stop , the other Start . Neo is a Stop characterhe has to stop considering whether he is or is n't the chosen One . Sarah , on the other hand , has to Start taking action , begin taking the initiative . Neo has the chip on his shoulder , Sarah has the hole in her heart ( more ways than one ) . <p> Again , with only this simple barebones analysis it is clear to see how the Dramatica perspective on the meaning of a story is vastly superior to the Heros Journey or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a story then simply entering a Special World and Returning Home with an Elixir .

The key lies within an accurate comprehension of the original source materials structure . <p> There can be nothing more depressing than the disappointment that comes from a failed attempt at adapting ones favorite novel . This sad event , usually proceeded by many anxious weeks of questioning Will they or wont they ? , culminates with that final moment when one sits down and the curtain parts . As that first frame lights up , the anticipation of an experience as memorable as the first read pushes one forward in their seats . <p> Unfortunately more often than not , this breathless hope wilts away , dashed upon the craggy rocks of insipidly forced plot points and false moments of character . <p> Why does this happen ? Is there something inherently different between the written word and the cinematic frame that makes it impossible for one to live up to the original ? <p> The easy answer lies in the understanding that novels are primarily internal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques can cause issues in communicating certain parts of a story , the real problem is actually something much deeper . After all , there have been successful adaptations . One need not look much further than the works of Stephen King for proof of this . <h> A Story For Every Season <p> Written in 1982 , Different Seasons is a collection of four short stories organized into the quarterly sections of the year . Technically speaking , the stories within are not exactly short , they more closely approach novellas , but the discussion about the processes used to adapt them is fundamentally the same . A story is a story , no matter how big or how small . As different in tone as they are in subject , each story inspired other artists to the task of adapting them for the big screen . <p> Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption became Frank Darabonts The Shawshank Redemption ( 1994 ) , Apt Pupil became Bryan Singers Apt Pupil ( 1998 ) , The Body became Rob Reiners Stand By Me ( 1986 ) , and the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the screen , though there are rumors that someone is taking a stab at it . Attention will therefore be focused on the middle two as the last has yet to be adapted and the first has already claimed the title of The Best Movie Ever Made . No need to analyze perfection . <p> When one wishes to examine the spectrum of successful adaptations , there can be no better example than The Body and Apt Pupil . One was successful . The other was an aberration . One was an instant classic that builds upon the original source material . The other was a complete bomb that trashed any semblance of Kings original message . <p> What is most interesting is that both films significantly modified their respective endings . In The Body it is n't Gordie ( played by Wil Wheaton in the film ) who shoots the gun , but rather Chris ( River Phoenix ) who pulls the trigger . In Apt Pupil , Todd ( Brad Renfro in the film ) does n't  bounce a basketball menacingly , he loads up his rifle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking off innocent drivers . <p> So why did Stand By Me become a classic and Apt Pupil become a complete dud ? <p> Performances notwithstanding , the reason for the formers success lies in the fact that the original structure was left intact . <h> Resolve and Meaning <p> One of the most important concepts of meaningful story structure , perhaps the most important , lies in what the Main Character decides to do at the end of a story . From the moment trouble begins ( popularly referred to as the Inciting Incident ) , the Main Character sets upon an approach to deal with those problems . As the story progresses , so too do the challenges to her resolve . Eventually she reaches the point of greatest climax wherein she is faced with a decision : either continue doing things the way she always has or try something new . Because of the challenges she faced throughout the story , this decision can easily fall one way or another . That is why it is often referred to as a Leap of Faith momentthe Main Character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Leap of Faith moment helps to communicate the Authors original message . If the Author wishes to say , Look , she was going about things the wrong way , then they construct a story wherein her adoption of this new way of doing things solves her own personal problems ( see Nora in Ibsens A Doll House ) . If they wanted to take the cautionary tale route , they could also construct a story wherein the Main Characters determination to stick with their original approach only causes more problems for them personally ( see Clarice in The Silence of the Lambs ) . <p> Likewise , if the Author wanted to say , Look , she was going about things the right way , then they could construct a story where the Main Characters steadfast determination made things better for them personally ( Eliza in My Fair Lady ) . Or , if they wanted to show the other side , they would create a story where the Main Characters decision to try a different approach only ended up adding to the personal angst they already had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Either method is fine , and it should be noted that this explanation is a gross generalizationthere all kinds of subtleties that could be built upon thisbut the concept itself is solid and vastly important when it comes to communicating the message of the story . If stories are about solving problems , then it would make sense that there would be a meaningful connection between the Main Character and how they ultimately approach the problems in the story . If the Author has something important to say then this concept of the Main Characters final decision , or resolve , will have some relation to their emotional well-being at the end of the story . <h> The Right Approach <p> Rob Reiner , along with writers Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans , did a masterful job of maintaining this structural relationship in their adaptation of The Body . As mentioned before , the major difference between book and film was who fired the gun that kept Ace and his cronies from taking credit for the find . In the movie , Gordie left them speechless . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions though , Gordies resolve was the same . Because of the issues surrounding his brother Dennys death , Gordie had developed an approach wherein he always took the safe route , preferring to avoid the repercussions of conflict rather than face them head on . Gordie says nothing when Ace takes his brothers hat , overreacts to Chriss reveal of the pilfered gun , and stalls crossing the trestle just long enough to close the gap between their location and the approaching train . This learned approach causes him plenty of anguish . <p> In the end , though , he takes a chance regardless of what may or may not happen to him . Confronting the older kids , without a thought towards how these physically superior thugs will end up paying him back , shows that Gordie has decided to take an alternative approach to the one he started out with . Kings message was that this change of character was the right thing to do . The boys leave and Gordie finds his place in the world . <p> It is only how Gordies confrontation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is where the whole " books are internal , films are external " idea comes into place . Gordies growth of character in the book takes place almost entirely within his own head . Sure , the overreaction to the gun and the delay at the trestle were external manifestations , but his eventual " Leap of Faith " amounted to a single line in the book : <p> what I heard coming out of my mouth instead of sweet reason was my own death warrant : " Suck my fat one , you cheap dimestore hood . " <p> Because the film lacked the ability to show how significant these words were to Gordies emotional growth , the filmmakers needed to find some external way of providing the same dramatic punch . Thus , the idea that Gordie should be the one to reveal the gun . And to help show what a monumental change this was , they added the scenes of Ace stealing his older brothers hat in the beginning . The hat did n't  even exist in the original story . <p> Rob Reiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this story , and found a way to externalize many of Gordies struggles without compromising the original meaning behind them . The film maintained the bittersweet ending present in the source material by making sure that , regardless of what tragedies befell his friends in the years to come , Gordie LaChance grew to a point where he could finally resolve the issues revolving around the looming shadow of his older brother and find some relative internal peace . <p> Which brings us to the train wreck that is Apt Pupil . <h> The Wrong Approach <p> In the Summer of 1974 , young Todd Bowden discovers his " GREAT INTEREST " Nazis and their atrocious war crimes of the Second World War . The knowledge of their heinous acts , many of which were committed in public and without restraint , ignites the teenagers imagination so much so that he can barely get to sleep at night . He wants to know more and more of what happened , every last detail , and luckily meets someone who can give it to him : retired Nazi war criminal Dussander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become more and more public with their violent tendencies . <p> And so ends the similarities between book and film . <p> In Bryan Singers version , Dussander locks Todd in his basement with a vagrant who needs finishing off . Dussander had plunged a knife deep in the visitors back , yet was interrupted by a heart attack before he could complete the job . Todd is forced to defend himself and in doing so murders the poor helpless man . Besides being oddly disturbing in tone ( as opposed to similar fare like The Silence of the Lambs or Se7en ) , this scene completely breaks the structure of the original story . <p> In the book , Todds growth into a killer was something he did on his own time and under his own volition , it was not something he was forced into . Anyone placed into the same basement situation as Todd might have have reacted the same . His violent act came off more as an act of self-defense rather than the natural progression of someone incited towards a more public display of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original story . <p> The thing that interested Todd so much about the Nazis was that their crimes were so brazen , almost as if their evil was tacitly accepted by those around them . This is what excites him and what motivates him to grow into the evil kid he finally turns out to be . Many of the Nazis believed that what they were doing what was right . And in the end of the original novella , Todd ends up doing what he thinks is right : <p> He thought he would clean his rifle and just sort of think the whole thing over . Try to get it straight in his mindhe closed his eyesWhen he opened them again , he felt better than he had in monthsmaybe better than he had felt in years . <p> This is Todds Leap of Faith moment . Sitting there , contemplating his recent murder of guidance counselor Rubber Ed , Todd decides to take that different approach . No longer content to hide in the shadows , Todd takes his struggle to the bluff overlooking the highway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Changing the Meaning <p> The original story was saying Look , Todd was going about things the wrong way . He shouldnt have kept this all to himself , if he wanted relief , he should have been more public about it . As an Audience we revolt at the very thought of doing something like this , but the world of a complete story ca n't be argued with , it can only be accepted . This is the power of the original story . <p> Kings version of Apt Pupil is as much a story of Triumph as Star Wars ever was . That feeling of contentment one feels during the final pages of that story juxtaposed with the morality of the events is what gives it that dark twisted ending . That repulsion is the essence of its genius . <p> Even director Bryan Singer found the ending extraordinary : <p> I told King the ending reads so beautifully . I could never measure up to it ; I would have killed it . <p> This is , of course , his defense for altering the ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations to take control , Singer garbled the Original Intent of Kings story . <p> Threatening Rubber Ed with accusations of homosexuality reveals that Todd has decided to continue taking the same approach as he always has , not change as he did in the book . After all , he manipulated his way into Dussanders house , why are his vague threats any different ? The film deviates completely from the original source materials story structure . <p> In the book , Todd grows to a place where he chooses a different approach ; he becomes the " Apt Pupil " from which the novella finds its title . In the film , he simply soldiers on , shooting that dark scowl he had almost from the beginning . All hopes of transmitting Kings original message become flights of fancy and flittering visions of what could have been . <p> Adaptation becomes rank disappointment . <h> Structure Carries A Films Message <p> Alter the structure and the message becomes unintelligible . <p> Both book and film started out the same way .

When he does n't  , the Audience feels let down and empty as if the last panel of a comic strip has been left off . As reprehensible a message as it was , that was the intended message . Placating advisory boards by breaking structure and meddling with the message and motives behind Kings initial creative impulse , the filmmakers behind Apt Pupil did a great disservice to great meaningful storytelling . <h> Adaptation Requires An Understanding of Structure <p> In sharp contrast to The Body , the artists behind Apt Pupil pulled their punches , and in doing so fell flat on their faces . <p> Successful adaptation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The structure of a story is responsible for communicating the Authors Original Intent . Reworking or modifying the original construct can only end in confusion and disappointment for the Audience . There is something the original Author was trying to say , something that drew its initial audience and inspired the " GREAT INTEREST " of the potential filmmakers in the first place . <p> Why not respect that creative impulse and build upon it ? 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> What the Main Character decides to do at the Leap of Faith moment signifies their Main Character Resolve . Whether their decision leads them to a place of peace or a pit of even greater angst determines the Story Judgment . The two coupled together help to communicate the meaning , or perspective on life , the Author wishes to share with them . <p> Change can be Good , Change can be Bad . Remaining Steadfast can be Good as well as Bad . Every combination is open to an Author , its all a matter of what they want to say and what kind of story they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Body and Apt Pupil , the Change/Good combination was depicted . Gordie overcame his Problems of Conscience with Temptation , and in doing so effectively closed the door on the issues he suffered due to the death of his older brother . <p> Todd overcame his sleepless nights caused by the Knowledge of what the Nazis did by taking a moment to Think and to really process all that came before . When he opens his eyes , all the angst and turmoil that had been growing inside of him simply disappears . Todd is in a better place emotionally , comfortable with what he feels he needs to do . <p> This is why the story carries such a dark emotional weight to it . As an Audience we have been told that Todds Change was a Good thinga change that most would find morally reprehensible . By leaving this deeply meaningful ending out of the adapted version , the filmmakers not only disappointed many Stephen King fans , they left audiences brand new to the story completely lost as to what the point of the film was .

The most frustrating aspect is the fact that all the pieces were there for a complete story , they just went unused and underdeveloped . There was a spark of an argument between " 9 " and " 1 " ( the young idealist who wants to move forward vs. the old religious who would rather hide in fear ) but it never really flared up into anything meaningful . Most unusual though is the almost complete lack of a Main Character throughline .

Gravity was designed to be experienced entirely from within . Adding this in would have diminished the experience .

@@119273026 @8273026/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> How To Write A Television Series <h> Crafting a serialized narrative is easy once you know the storyform . <p> Writing and producing a television series is difficult . With the recent popularity of streaming services and " binge watching " , writing and producing a television series is daunting . Trying to tell a serialized story over the course of a season or several seasons overwhelms even the most accomplished writer . <p> There is a way , however , to streamline the process while making it both productive and fun . <p> This was particularly true with Jessica Jones , which reached a climactic point around the middle of its first season , then screwed around for several episodes before staging its final battle . By the time Jessica faced off with the seasons main supervillain , their encounter did n't  nearly have as much potency as it would have if the season had run for only eight episodes instead of 13 . <p> This only happens because the shows creators are unaware of the storyform they are trying to tell . Whether strung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamically interesting story can be told as long as the storys dynamics are kept in check . Outlining a television series to tell a single story in such a way that it does not " sag " in the middle is possible : you just have to know Dramatica . <p> A Dramatica storyform is a collection of 75 different story points that communicate the original intent of the Authors narrative . While the purpose of the storyform is to maintain the integrity of the Authors message , it also has the beneficial side effects of insuring there are no " story holes " and that characters stay motivated and tightly interwoven within a dynamic and developing plot . Knowing this storyform and using it to outline your work is the best way to avoid any of the pitfalls VanDerWerff speaks of . <h> Telling a Single Story <p> Streaming services have an unfortunate tendency to assume they should use all the time in a season " including the extra moments freed up by not having to remind viewers of certain plot developments " to tell a single story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart and productive approach . Audiences only want to know that the time they give to a show is time well spentthey want the experience to be meaningful . As long as the writers and producers have something to say and know how to say it , they can easily fill 13 episodes with thematic material that captures the audiences attention and keeps them engaged . The first season of HBOs True Detective did this ; by crafting a coherent and complete structure they delivered a powerful and captivating story . <p> In those instances where you do find that the story " sags " or lingers in the middle , you can fill that gap by defining a smaller storyform for a single episode . <p> These last , extremely small storyforms , do n't  necessarily have to have anything to do with the larger storyforms at play . For instance , think back to The X-Files and their mythology vs. monster episodes . The mythology had one single storyform spread out over several episodes ; the monster episodes had one storyform per episode . Classics like Clyde Bruckmans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own . <p> The recent update to the series ( 2016 ) took a similar approach : one storyform for the two bookend episodes and then different storyforms for the interior episodes . Data needed to develop and complete the larger over-arching storyform found itself woven into some of those self-contained episodes while there was one that stood out on all its own . <h> Epic Storyforming <p> The number of fictional works that are so dense that they require tellings longer than three hours is pretty slim . Certainly , gigantic epic novels like The Lord of the Rings or War and Peace fall into this category . But most other stories are rather slim when you come right down to it , and stretching them out just means adding pointless incidents and busywork , stuff that distracts from the storys " spine , " or its most central conflict . <p> The Lord of the Rings in fact had several different storyforms all running concurrently . This is yet another approach writers and producers can take to flesh out and more fully develop their seasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about " sagging " , they can easily and confidently run several storyforms at the same time within the same work . You simply need to know what it is you are trying to say . <h> Knowing Your Storyform <p> The storyform acts as the carrier wave for the Authors intent . Plug in what conflict you want to explore , how you want it to turn out , and how you want the audience to feel about how it turned out , and Dramatica will provide you with a storyform . <p> Of course , stories are more than their conflicts . The best ones feature interesting characters who drive the plot forward , and those characters could help or hinder the progression of that plot through their actions . And all stories have obstacles that stand between the characters and their ultimate objectiveBut the number of obstacles a writer can organically introduce into a story before those obstacles start to feel pointless and random is very small . <p> This only happens when the writer or producer has no clue as to the storyform . Vince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Beau Willimon may not have direct knowledge of Dramatica and its concept of the storyform , but their writers instinctwhich is what Dramatica was built ondrive them to craft stories that do have complete storyforms.1 Shakespeare did n't  have access to a Mac , yet Hamlet , Romeo and Juliet , and Othello stand out as prime examples of solid storyforming . Bill had something to say and his legacy persists because of his effectiveness in communicating that message . <p> Dramatica just makes it easier . <h> Replicating the Bricks <p> A story can be told in a scene , or in an episode , or in a handful of them . But over a full season or series , it can easily fall apart , as writers lose focus and the obstacles placed in front of characters start to feel random and unmotivated . Streaming shows , because of how they 're presented to us , tend to look at the wall of a great series like The Wire and assume they just need replicate that wall . But that 's not the solution at all . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogy , but not entirely accurate . Crafting self-contained episodes , or bricks , can be an effective deterrent to unmotivated narrative . However , replicating the chemical makeup of the bricks and understanding the fractal nature of those bricks within the wall would better serve writers and producers . Dramatica helps to identify those base components of narrative . <p> The key to combatting this problem of losing focus lies in knowing exactly what storyform a particular episodes or series of episodes is telling . There are so many story points within a single storyformnot including the 45 or so sequences hidden deep within the storyformthat a writer would find it rather difficult to maintain a story that felt " random " or " unmotivated " . As always , clarity in regards to intentwhether through character , plot , theme , or genrekeeps an audience engaged regardless of length . <p> Size does n't  matter when the message is clear . <p> Vince Gilligan is responsible for Breaking Bad , David Simon The Wire , and Beau Willimon House of Cards . ? ?

The strange hiccup that occurs when their relationship first begins ( " I ca n't be your friend " ) can be attributed to the fallout of this approach . <p> In addition , the Main Character is more clearly presented as a Holistic Problem Solver with his focus on maintaining the tender balance between he and his fanged friend .

Many want to say much , but much gets lost in the many ways of sending that message . Writers who comprehend the machine can convey their purpose with greater accuracy . <p> Everyone knows to divide a story into Acts . Ever since Aristotle first put into words " Beginning , Middle and End " , writers across the globe have grouped the events of their stories into large movements . Why not ? It feels right and generally leads to a complete , well-rounded story . <p> This is why Acts exist within a story . They signify the change in dramatic focus the characters take in order to solve the problems within a story . The reason there are only four acts in every complete story is because for every problem we can experience in our lives , there are four major contexts , or dramatic approaches , we can take in order to go about effective problem-solving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films and makes an argument why four movements cover conflict better than three . Investigating a set of mysterious deaths , and chasing down and capturing the men responsible mean nothing without an attempt to understand the motive for murder . A mysterious island playing captor to air-disaster victims , its dark and troubled history mixed with an almost certain doom of things to come falls short if it fails to also cover the deteriorating conditions of the fragile community the survivors have managed to construct . In each of these examples , the drive to solve propels the reader or Audience memeber from one movement to the next . Acts exist because the Audience has no idea where the solution of a story rests . <h> The Stick in the Aquarium <p> Chris Huntley , co-creator of the Dramatica theory of story , often refers to the analogy of a stick thrust into an aquarium when discussing the hidden nature of a storys problem . When you look at a stick from different angles , submerged in the water , you cant tell whether it is straight or bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water , or is it a crooked stick that looks straight for the same reason ? When looking from a single perspectiveas you do when only looking at it from the viewpoint of a single Actyou really cant tell . When you see things from a limited point-of-view , you do n't  notice the distortion . You have to look at the stick from all the different angles ( all the different Acts ) before you can safely answer that it is most likely straight or most likely bent.1 <p> More than an opportunity for increasing complications , Acts work to round out and complete the argument being made by helping us hone in on the actual problem . <h> The Spiral Locator <p> Imagine a coiled spiral . Somwhere on this spiral lies the inequity at the heart of a story . As we encounter this spiral at the beginning we have no clue as to where the problem sits . It could be at the top of the coil , at the bottom , or somewhere lost in the middle . We have no idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coilmoving up , moving downlooking for that bump , looking for that pea under the mattress until finally we hit upon it . Now we may still have more coil to investigate . Just because we think we 've found it in one area does n't  necessarily mean the problem wont rest in another . So we continue our trek until we have fully examined every inch of that story spiral . Only then can we confidently saythe problem most likely rests here . <p> Of course , then we need to check the spiral from alternative angles ( the other Throughlines of a story ) to cross-reference and remain honest with ourselves , but regardless , the mechanism is the same . View the conflict of a story from different contexts in order to determine the best possible area for resolution . <h> Plot as Context <p> The storyform for her shows how the unique pairing between Theodore and Samantha generates a Concern of Understanding between them . The previous article The Relationship Behind Every Great Story discusses how the Concern of the Relationship Story Throughline can also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Theodore and Twomblys relationship to work out , they need a better understanding of each other . <p> Diving deeper , the storyform for her lists the Act order for the relationship as Doing , Obtaining , Gathering Information and Understanding . This means the relationship between man and machine will be explored in terms of Doing in the First Act , Obtaining and Gathering Information in the Second , and Understanding in the Third . Take note of that last Act . The story takes the time to examine Understanding between them , even though that has been a Concern all along . As a Static Plot Point Appreciation , the Concern of a Throughline exists in every Act . Its there all the time . If Understanding was a Concern or potential Goal , why did they wait until the very last moment to explore it as a potential area for resolution ? <p> Remember the spiraled coil . Just because something is a Concern does n't  mean you know up front that that is what needs to be achieved or reached . The Author knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the objective view of a story held by the writer and the subjective view held by those experiencing the story . <p> Self-centered behavior drives the wedge between Theodore and Samantha . Self-awareness seen in terms of Doing is different than self-awareness seen in terms of Obtaining or in terms of Gathering Information or in terms of Understanding . By virtue of plot , the Audience looks at the same thing in each Actonly through a different context , a different lens . By viewing through these different lenses , the Audience gains a better understanding of where the problem truly is and ultimately how best to solve it . It might look like a problem in one context , but something entirely different in the next . The nature of the Act structure is one of realization : by the end of the story , the Audience knows as the Author does . <h> Identifying Meaning <p> When we look at the objective view of story provided by the Dramatica Table of Story Elements , we see time . When viewed from the subjective view of the Audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Author may have encoded the meaning , but as an Audience member were along for the ride . Temporal elements , like Signposts and Acts , have to be explored piecemeal in order to suss out that meaning . Plot acts as a filter . This mechanism of Acts acts as a lens granting greater resolution . <p> Looking at the base of the table we see 64 potential problems . In reality , these 64 are really the same four elements repeated . They only appear different because of the lens , or filter , from above . When we look at these elements from a single perspective , as we do with the example of the stick in the aquarium or through a single Signpost ( Act ) , we cant tell its true nature . We know its crooked . We sense the pea . We just ca n't be sure what it is because we do n't  know the level of distortion . <p> We need those multiple perspectives . We need those multiple contexts and subsequent Acts in order to better triangulate ( really quadrangulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodore and Samantha fail to reach that greater Understanding of one another . Having traversed those Acts and witnessed the same failure in the larger story , we know a greater awareness of our surroundings to be the answer to their interpersonal problems . We sense that relief that comes when Theodore walks up and outside and soaks in the world around him . We may have failed in our relationship , but we now know . <p> And we owe that greater understanding of what the films means to the mechanism behind it all . <p> Of course , you 'll never truly know for certain if the stick is straight or crooked until you remove it from the water , and that is the nature of a problem in a story . Its not really something you can define in a sentence or two . It is something that exists between things , an inequity that can only be approximated by the vantage points provided by the different Throughlines. ? ?

Others prefer to start by internalizing , adapting themselves to the problems that they face . The Main Characters Approach determines whether they instinctively veer towards the internal , or towards the external . <p> According to the Dramatica theory of story , this preference determines whether a Main Character is a Do-er or a Be-er .

It is not an absolute , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Characters will solve problems both externally and internally . Theyre based on real people after all . But it is important to determine which area they venture off into first . Why ? <p> Because this will set up the kind of dramatic issues the Main Character will face in the story . Everyone has read before how character is action or characters are what they do . These phrases represent the basic understanding that character is plot and plot is character . But on a deeper level what this really means is that the issues a character faces in a story will grow from the approaches they take . Do-ers face external issues . Be-ers face internal ones . <p> So if you want to figure out how to write a meaningful Main Character , it helps to know what kind of approach they prefer . <p> If they tend towards the external running in and taking action then the kinds of issues they will face will center on things external , like the future state of things or fighting for your country . Columbus in Zombieland is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of actions he thinks he has to take in order to stay in control . The story takes him to a place where he can stop doing these things.1 <p> If they instead prefer to adapt themselves changing who they are first then the types of issues they will face will focus on the internal , like a racist attitude , or a dysfunctional behavior . Ryan Bingham in Up In The Air is the kind of Main Character who prefers to approach things internally . His issues stem from this attitude he has that everyone else in the world is just excess baggage . The less you have in your backpack , the happier your life will be . The story allows him to grow , again , to a place where he can stop having this attitude and perhaps take some action to change things around for him . <h> Lesters Approach <p> In American Beauty , Lester prefers to take action in order to resolve the personal problems in his life : <p> EXT .

A client of ours finds himself surrounded with many steeped in this methodology and he was interested what Dramatica might have to say about it . Now that I 'm posting here everyday , I thought it might be interesting to jot down my findings . <p> This is a very difficult program for me to watch . <p> Like with most everything that is not Dramatica , the Sequence Method as presented in the video is a paradigm of story seen from the point-of-view of the Audience . And this is a very difficult perspective to take for someone who has immersed themselves in Dramatica for over two decades . Audiences vary , the story does not . Why would you want to base the foundation of a story on the opinion or opinions of various Audiences ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gulino himself : <p> The sequence method focuses on how the audience will experience the story and what the writer can do to make that story better . <p> There is nothing inherently wrong with this . Except for one thing : anything seen from the Audiences point-of-view is naturally subjective and therefore always open to interpretation . While the techniques of Storytelling and StoryReception outlined from this perspective are compelling , they do n't  deal with the actual construction of a story . <p> You ca n't start to cook a four course-meal by first asking I wonder how this will taste to everyone ?

You can ask that question during the process of cooking , or somewhere near the end , but asking it at the beginning will leave you paralyzed and unable to proceed . <p> No wonder so many writers think story is hard .

To be fair , it is funny and scary and nostalgic , but the story itselfit simply does n't  work . <p> Honestly , a trailer that good deserves a film that delivers the kind of emotional resonance of the Spielbergian films it evokes . There is an attempt to weave an injured familys struggle to overcome loss with sci-fi elements , but so much time is spent reliving the late 70s and the joys of adolescent filmmaking that the emotional throughlinesthe ones that really bring those tears to fruitionare left weakened and underdeveloped . <p> Main Character Joe Lamb ( Joel Courtney ) , while the kind of earnest and goodhearted character we can instantly fall in love with , is a virtual no-show in the area of point-of-view .

Exposition , exposition , yawn .

Beautiful idea and a great image . But the wrong person was holding it . How much more powerful would it have been if it was Jackson who had held on to the necklace all these months , and it was Joe who had to help his dad " let go " and release it to the water tower ?

You can always find elements of each Domain in every Throughline , but there were only be one Domain for a Throughline that resonates with the other three Throughlines . <p> At times it may seem as if we shoehorn stories into different boxes in order to somehow prove Dramatica right . You may sense hints of confirmation bias in our analyses or in our articles on story structure &amp; story theory . Nothing could be further from the truth . <p> Dramatica is a self-checking theory of story . In fact , the source of all frustration with the theory lies in the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or caveats . You can try to shoehorn in a singular source of conflict or a problematic issue for a particular Throughline , but you wo n't find that balance on the other side . In short , when you can easily find examples of conflict for all Throughlines at once , the entire hologram of narrative dynamics for that story will click into place . <p> Developing that sense of story is the foundation for a life of great writing . <h> The Four Throughlines of a Complete Story <p> As a reminderor brief introduction if you are new to Dramaticathe Four Throughlines provide an Audience different perspectives on the central inequity of a story : <p> As you start to identify the source of conflict in each of these Throughlines , two rules exist : <p> The Main Character &amp; Influence Character Throughlines sit diagonally across from each other <p> The Relationship Story &amp; Overall Story Throughlines sit diagonally across from each other <p> The explanation why one must adhere to these rules lies in the development of the Dramatica itself . In addition to the fractal nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest opportunity for conflict within a story . This is why you will find Pursuit diagonally across from Avoid , Faith diagonally across from Disbelief , and Conscience diagonally across from Temptation . Put those two elements in a room or scene together and watch the sparks fly . <p> Same with the Main Character &amp; Influence Character and the Overall Story and Relationship Story . Conceptually , the latter might be more difficult to comprehend but the dynamic between the two remains . Consider Arrival below : the relationship between Louise and the aliens directly impacts the Overall Story of trying to understand these creatures and vice versa . <h> The Only Arrangement of Conflict that Works <p> In Arrival , linguist Louise Banks ( Amy Adams ) struggles with painful memories of her daughter . Her " flashbacks " bring us into the story by offering the personal , intimate perspective found in the Main Character Throughline . As Audience members we grow with Louise and overcome our own Fixed Attitudes regarding time and our minds ability to deceive . <p> Challenging the linguist to think differently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation of the Relationship Story Throughline . The endeavor to manipulate how she thinks pulls the two closer and closer together until there exists a deeply felt sadness at the loss of one of the aliens . <p> The Hectapods find themselves in a difficult Situation : if Earth does n't  get its act together in the past , there will be no future for the Hectapods . Their ability to cross space and time to deliver an enigmatic message fulfills the Influence Character Throughlines purpose of impacting Louise to adopt a different approach . <p> And only by adopting a different approach herself , can Louise finally offer the key to resolve the Overall Story Throughline that finds Earth on the brink of all-out war . Communicating with aliens , leaking information , dissolving alliances , and committing treason define problems of Activities . <p> As you can see , arranging the Four Throughlines to cover these four sources of conflict feels right . You might be able to find instances of Louise struggling with her Situation of being alone , but would you be able to find issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact Louises Situation , they impact and challenge her Attitude . <p> Likewise , you can find instances where the Hectapods manipulate characters other than Louise , but then can you find examples of just Louise and the Hectapods trying to understand one another ?

@@119273048 @8273048/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Female Main Characters Who Think Like Female Main Characters <p> Excitement abounds with Pixars latest announcement that next years film , Brave , features the studios first female lead character , Merida . Long seen as a boys-only studio , Pixars bold move captures the hearts and minds of those left unrepresented with the lamps past offerings . <p> But is it truly a watershed moment for the studio ? <p> Ignoring temporarily the fact that late last year male director Mark Andrews replaced female director Brenda Chapman , Merida hides an even deeper and darker secret beneath her ginger locks . <h> The Experience of Solving Problems <p> Viewed through the context of structure , complete stories focus on the process of solving a problem . The Main Character gives the audience a way into that experience and affords them the opportunity firsthand to see how things work out . In short , the audience becomes this character . However , certain structural choices within a story can make it difficult for a portion of the audience to connect directly with the Main Character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central character thinks . <h> Linearity is from Mars , Holism is from Venus <p> Main Characters come in two different flavors : those who approach problem-solving linearly and those who approach problem-solving holistically . They can do both , but one will always appear to be more prevalent than the other . <p> Linear problem-solvers think primarily in terms of cause and effect . They see a problem and determine the sequential steps to solve it . In contrast , holistic problem-solvers think primarily in terms of balancing relationships . Rather than focusing on the individual steps , holistic solvers work the forces on disparate items , trying to shift the relationships between things . <p> Two completely different ways of approaching problems , each appropriate in its own way . <p> But what does this have to do with telling stories ? <p> Male audience members expect their Main Characters to solve problems linearly . Why ? Because at a base instinctual level , that is how they themselves solve problems . They do n't  understand how a character solves a problem any other way . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but theyll never be able to truly relate to it . Shifting balances ? If you 're male and reading this , chances are you read that and thought , How can anyone solve problems that way ? How does that even work ? Isnt it easier to just attack the problem head on ? <p> That same feeling reverberates through 1/2 of the audience out there when the Main Character does n't  solve problems linearly . <p> Merida wont take that chance . <h> The Mass Market Appeal of the Linear Thinker <p> Female audience members relate easily to linear thinkers . They empathize with them just as much as they do with holistic thinkers , because at a base instinctual level they solve problems holistically . Holism understands linearity . They may wonder sometimes why the linear thinker ca n't see the forest for the trees , but theyll never have an issue relating because that 's what they do . They relate . <p> So if linear Main Characters grab 100% of the audience and holistic Main Characters only grab half that , how do you think studio accountants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go about solving problems ? <p> Beyond box office success , an even greater problem exists , particularly in the case of Brave , when it comes to the way a Main Character approaches problems . As difficult as it is for male audience members to empathize with holistic thinkers , its ten times as hard for male writers or directors to infuse their Main Characters with this kind of thinking . The task becomes too monumental , even if an understanding of this concept exists . Much easier to go with what you knowespecially if it means more tickets sold . <p> Merida will be a linear thinker . No doubt . She will do everything a boy can do and shell do it with flair and strength . But she wo n't do everything a girl can do . She will appeal to both male and female audience members and Pixars reign of the mass market will continue en masse . They will appear to be expanding their horizons , but in reality , they wo n't . <p> Merida wont truly be a female main character . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont be in good company : Ripley in Alien ( and Aliens ) , Nina in Black Swan , Ree in Winters Bone , Giselle in Enchanted , Maria in The Sound of Musicthe list goes on and on . Linear thinkers sheathed in female players . Again , in order to appeal to the largest audience , these stories focus on Main Characters who solve problems through cause and effect . <p> Think to Ree in Winters Bone . If she is to care for her younger siblings , then she is going to have to find her father , regardless of the cost . A holistic thinker would have worked on shifting the balance with her uncle or with any of the other kindly citizens around her . Not to cause anything to happen per se , but rather to shift the balance of things so that a solution might present itself . But she did n't  . Instead , she worked the problem step-by-step , following an Ozarkian connect-the-dots to her fathers eventual location . <p> Maria , from The Sound of Music , took the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing . Problem solved : shell wear the drapes ! And the kids cant possibly get their nice clothes soiled while playing , so theyll get some window dressing fashion as well . Cause and effect . Addressing the problem at its source . This is why , when the Captain takes his first extensive lead , Maria can so easily disobey his rules . A holistic thinker would have given thought to maintaining the balance in their relationship , perhaps not allowing the children to climb trees or carry on in a way that might upset the Captain . But not Maria . The kids needed more playtime , and she knew exactly how to solve that problem . <p> Incidentally , Winters Bone based its narrative on a novel by Daniel Woodrell . The Sound of Music , though based on a memoir by Maria von Trapp , was fictionalized as a story by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse . Mark Heyman , Andres Heinz and John McLaughin wrote Black Swan . Enchanted by Bill Kelly . <p> Notice a pattern ? <p> To repeat , Debra Granik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel of Winters Bone because holistic thinkers simply do n't  struggle with linearity . It is when linear thinkers try to write holistic thinkers that a story can run into trouble . <p> Faced with catering the marriage of her one true love to another woman , the Main Character of Like Water for Chocolate , Tita , bakes her heartache into the food she prepares . Soon disaster strikesthe wedding guests lose their minds , wailing over their long lost loves . Not exactly a clear case of cause and effect . A linear thinker would have confronted Pedros decision or perhaps even run off in much the same way that Maria did in The Sound of Music . But Tita did n't  . Instead she finds a way to shift the balance of her pain , preparing meals so sensual as if to communicate the essence of her love for Pedro without any consideration to the effect she might cause . Her approach , while foreign to some , was perfectly holistic . An approach that turned out to be an appropriate way to solve her problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same approach . She cant for the life of her understand why Bud does n't  like her . So what does she do ? She shows up with another date . How the heck does that even make any sense ? many of the male audience members think to themselves . Yet , to a holistic thinker , it makes perfect " sense " . By creating a dynamic between her and Bud and the other men , she thinks that somehow shell be able to balance things out . Shift the dynamics in her favor . Her approach is one of trying to change the relationships around her and the relationships with her . There is purpose , yet it is the means to that end that might seem foreign to some ( at least , to yours truly it does ) . <p> OK , but were talking about Tennessee Williams here . If there ever was an exception to a rule of authors and their Main Characters , he would be it . And William Inge was both a contemporary of Williams and an accomplished playwright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grass ( And technically there is a sub-story that features Bud as the Main Character ) . These are master writers , craftsmen who could write a wide range of characters on both sides of the problem-solving aisle . They are the exception . <p> This writing of holistic Main Characters by male writers happens , but only by truly accomplished writers and by writers who want to explore a character who solves problems holistically . <h> Writing What You Think , Not What You Know <p> The elation that comes with Pixars " brave " move should find temperance in the knowledge that not much has changed . Yes , Meridas appearance front and center stuns us , but the way she thinks and solve problems wont . She ca n't if the studio hopes to appeal to the largest possible audience . And she wo n't , particularly in light of the aforementioned director shuffle . <p> Instead , Merida will be yet another in the long line of boys in girls clothing . Not that there 's anything wrong with that . There have been many amazing and enthralling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the notion that somehow this film will feel different than the Pixar films before it , or that it somehow showcases a turning point in the studios history might be a bit of a jump in logic . <p> There are female Main Characters who think linearly just as much as there are male Main Characters who think holistically . Look to The X-Files for proof of that . In story , gender has no correlation with how a character goes about solving problems . In story , it is all about how a character thinks , not how a character looks . Gender be damned . <p> Still , while Merida may be pretty , beauty is only skin deep . So too is the notion that Brave represents a step forward and a chance to finally hear from the other side . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Dramatica refers to this concept of character as the Main Characters Problem-Solving Process . This term was originally called the Main Characters Mental Sex , but as you can imagine it stirred up all sorts of controversial and confusing conversation that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linear Problem-Solving and Female Mental Sex to Holistic Problem-Solving , the barriers to a greater understanding of story became a little easier to climb . <p> The only problem is that the connection between linear thinking and the male mind and holistic thinking and the female mind still needs addressing when it comes to the concept of Audience Reach . The male blind-spot exists in the difference between linear thinking and holistic thinking . This is why many tune out of " chick-flicks " or stories where the Main Character refuses to work in cause and effect . <p> The blind-spot for the female mind exists in a completely different area . Here , the Story Limit becomes the deciding factor . Female audience members can empathize with Optionlocks but only sympathize with Timelocks . Deadlines and ticking clocks reveal their weakness of empathy . This is why most sports with a majority female audience focus on points ( options ) rather than quarters or periods ( time ) .

@@119273052 @8273052/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> What Story Structure Is and Isnt <p> Beginning , middle and end . Aristotle figured it out centuries ago and the rest of us are simply repeating his work with new fangled terminology , right ? Far from it . <p> Story structure is not simply opening and closing images , midpoints , dark nights of the soul , three acts that break at 30-60-90 , spiritual transformations , progressive complications , whammies and reversals . These are all storytelling devices . They add flavor to a solid story structure , not meaning . This is why they do n't  apply to every story , why the order in which they appear shifts , and why so often they seem like matters of interpretation . Their use varies depending on the individual style of the writer . <h> The Journey of Writing a Story <p> In a recent presentation writer/director Guillermo del Toro made mention of his disdain for story structure and for the familiar systems propagated by the Robert McKees and Blake Snyders of the world . Reiterating his analogous comparison between the competing writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist and traveler , he began to expand on his particular approach to writing . <p> A tourist arrives on scene with a set itinerary , a list of popular sites to visit and a schedule within which to visit them . A traveler , on the other hand , experiences the foreign land with little to no boundaries , and no presumptions about what the trip will entail . Preferring the latter , del Toro explained that he would much rather experience " diarrhea in a corner " rather than burden himself with the expected . <p> What writer would n't ? <p> The allure of the wandering minstrel , of the romanticism involved with not knowing ones path , runs through the genetic code of any writer and of any artist . Who wants to be told what to do when creating ? The problem with this analogy lies in an all too familiar misconception of story structure . <p> Story structure exists to convey and support an Authors argument , not to stipulate a framework of fifteen familiar beats . <h> Crafting an Argument <p> In that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobedience and choice clearly present within his masterful film Pans Labyrinth were subject matter that he intentionally set out to write , or if they were simply happy accidents he discovered along his travels . Without skipping a beat he answered confidently that yes , the problems of disobedience or rather lack of disobedience , were guiding lights in some of the decisions he made when writing the original screenplay . <p> This is story structure . <p> When an Author sets out to say something , to prove something to a willing audience , he or she is using story structure . Utilizing character , plot , theme and genre , an Author sets out to argue a particular point-of-view . The success of a story depends on how much the Author aligns their work with the natural problem-solving processes of the human mind ( mentioned in the last article The Real Magic Behind Great Stories ) . The more " broken " or stilted this process is , the weaker or more meaningless a story becomes . <p> Pans Labyrinth works because Guillermo del Toro was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Different Perspectives on a Common Problem <p> When arguing a point , particularly when a writer ca n't be there to answer any counter-arguments ( as in the case of a film delivered to a wide and international Audience ) , it becomes necessary to cover all the bases . In story , this completeness of argument comes by exploring the four different contextsI , You , We and They . These equate , respectively , to the Main Character in a story ( I ) , the character who challenges their way of seeing things ( You ) , the relationship that develops between the two ( We ) , and the big picture story involving all the characters ( They ) . Arguing only one side of the argument or only some of the perspectives leads to a story that feels pointless or lightweight . Thankfully Pans Labyrinth does not suffer from this , leaving many an audience member satiated and emotionally fulfilled . <p> An exploration of del Toros 2006 fairy tale classic begins with young Ofelia ( Ivana Baquero ) . Seated at the emotional center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , that of the Main Character . Through her eyes we experience what it would be like to be a slumbering Princess tasked with completing three important trials . <p> Diametrically opposed to her sits the fantastical creature , Pan ( Doug Jones ) . He challenges the way Ofelia sees herself , manipulating her growth of character by presenting her with opportunities to act the way one of her nobility should . <p> Together they form a relationship and the third perspective on the storys problem . It is within this context that one can begin to see the inklings of the argument . At first following orders without question , Ofelia gradually , but resolutely , begins to oppose Pans demands . Her experience with the Pale Man , of opening a different door and eating the food she was explicitly told not to , keys an Audience in on the films message and the writers purpose in telling this particular story . <p> Contrast this with the fourth and final perspective , that of the adults and the Spanish Civil War , and the storys argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives an Audience a subjective look into the problems faced when not questioning authority , it is through the battles between the Facists and the Rebels that we begin to see those problems from an objective third-person perspective . As the Doctor ( -lex Angulo ) so clearly points out in his rain-soaked scenes , he is not like the evil Captain Vidal ( Sergi L=pez ) . He does not follow orders without question . Again , more clues to the Authors argument . <p> Four perspectives , four familiar contexts ( I , You , We , They ) on a single problemin this case , an overabundance of trust . <h> Wrapping Up an Argument <p> The ending of a story acts as a clue towards the Authors original purpose in setting down those first words.Pans Labyrinth argues that only by repudiating the voices of authority can one find triumph . Evident in Ofelias final gold-laced scenes , her act of defiance against Pan guaranteed her life-everlasting with both father and mother . If she had continued to do things the way she always had , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fulfilling . <p> And , as if to hammer home his position on the importance of disobedience , del Toro offers the same in the bigger picture , albeit with a grace and subtlety of expression that eludes most contemporary American filmmakers . <p> Problems begin in Pans Labyrinth when Captain Vidals son arrives with step-daughter in tow . Without Ofelias presence and the matching focus of attention on her threat to the babys natural progression as heir of Vidals reign , there would be no storyno problem to solve . Ofelias first interaction with Vidal functions as the first fallout from this Inciting Incident . <p> Pursuing the successful resolution of the Storys Goala continuation of power flowing from grandfather to father and father to sonis Vidal himself , placing himself firmly in the role of Protagonist . While at first glance this may seem an unnatural choice , especially considering his villainous tendencies , impartiality must supplant value judgment when assuming the objective look at a storys problem . The story introduces a problem and the Protagonist works to resolve it ; good and evil have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventual comeuppance feels less like a triumphant Hurrah ! worthy of the halls of the Throne Room scene in Star Wars or the deck of the aircraft carrier in Top Gun , and more like the bittersweet successes found in The Lives of Others or Michael Clayton . Mercedes ( Maribel Verdf ) , and her merry band of Spanish rebels , have prevented the successful resolution of the storys central goal . Vidals son will never know his fathers name , the continuation of power will no longer exist . The Protagonist has failed . Proof of this lies in his final act of violence against Ofelia . <p> While Ofelia eventually grew to a point where she could stand up and test those beliefs once held true , Vidal continues to act without question . Believing all along that Ofelias intentions were to kill his only son , Vidal had no choice but to shoot her . Instead of seeing the fruits of overcoming the storys problem , the Audience bears witness to what happens when the problem persists . Subjectively we see the joy that comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure that comes from not questioning . The combination of the two supplies a resonance of meaning unheard of in lesser films . <p> Effective story structure developed and finalized the original argument Guillermo del Toro set out to make . It was not an after thought . <h> Seeking a Destination with Purpose <p> Seeing story structure as a mechanism for providing meaning , for supporting an Authors argument , flows effortlessly from that initial spark to create . Most writers of narrative fiction write because they want to create something that has weight , something that is greater than the sum of its parts . This intangible extra benefit they seek with their work comes as a result of giving an Audience something they cant get in their day-to-day lives : a look at problem solving both from within and without , objective and subjective . Whether they realize they are doing so or not , writers who write with purpose utilize structure to relay their message . <p> They may be traveling , but there is always a reason why they originally chose the path . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Snyder and the Heros Journey advocates of the world , make no mention of supporting an Authors purpose in writing . They feel more like a didactic exploration of familiar cultural hotspots rather than a helpful shaman along for the trek . It is structure as seen from the eyes of the Audience , an unfortunate reality that will often feel like an imposition on a writers natural sensibilities . <p> In that respect , these paradigms of story will always feel like a tourist trap . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> In three of the four throughlines , Trust functions as the Problem . Defined as an acceptance of knowledge as proven without first testing its validity , this element works perfectly both for Ofelias personal throughline , her tenuous relationship with Pan , and for the Overall Story Throughline . <p> Test would therefore be the Solution .

@@119273053 @8273053/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> How to Find the Narrative Code Within a Great Story <h> Great writers need to be great analysts in order to fully understand the mechanism of their stories . <p> Within every great narrative sits a comprehensive and elaborate tapestry of story points . The reason a particular story feels good eliciting that Oh , that 's a great movie reaction is because these points resonate on a frequency that touches upon the way our own minds work . Those looking to communicate effectively with Audiences across the world must understand this narrative code that rests at the foundation of every great story . <p> In Dramatica , a storyform is a unique collection of seventy-plus story points that work together to form a holistic image of the Authors Intent . Authors use competing points-of-view and alternative approaches to solving problems to argue their own points-of-view on the best way to resolve the issues in our lives . For most , this is a hunt-and-seek process that involves several rewrites before the argument begins to take shape . With Dramatica , Authors can identify what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comprehensive structure that helps support that point-of-view . <p> By analyzing a narrative through the eyes of Dramatica " particularly one as comprehensive and meaningful as The Dark Horse " Authors can develop the skills necessary to effectively recognize and appreciate their own storys unique set of story points . The more familiar an Author becomes with a storyform and how each and every part relates , the more comfortable and confident they become when it comes to structuring their own stories . <h> Identifying the Four Throughlines <p> Before diving in to the deep thematics present within each and every scene , the analyst must first identify the Four Throughlines of the story . <p> Narrative drive exists wherever there is an inequity . No imbalance , no story . Yet , one can not focus in on the inequity and simply describe it " the Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao . Instead Authors approximate and speak around the inequity by offering an Audience four different ways of looking at it : <h> Locating the Domain of Conflict for Each Throughline <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Throughlines to a particular Domain , or area , of conflict . In our Universe , conflict can be found in four different arenas : <p> a Situation ( fixed external conflict ) <p> an Activity ( a process of external conflict ) <p> a Fixed Attitude ( fixed internal conflict ) <p> a Manner of thinking ( a process of internal conflict ) <p> In Dramatica , these four areas align into a quad where the external conflict sit on top , and the internal conflicts rest on the bottom . The fixed conflicts find themselves diagonally across from one another as do the processes of conflict . <p> Only one rule when assigning Throughlines to Domains , the following must be diagonally across from each other : <h> Determining Character and Plot Dynamics <p> From there , the analyst begins identifying the answers to dynamic questions that pinpoint the forces that twist and turn the narrative . Dramatica begins with 32,768 possible storyforms . Answering these questions helps narrow down the possibilities and focuses the story engine in on the Authors original intent . <p> The four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does he Change the way he approaches problems or does he Remain Steadfast ? <p> Main Character Growth Does he hold out for something to Start or something to Stop ? <p> Main Character Approach Does he prefer to solve problems externally as a Do-er , or internally as a Be-er ? <p> The first and third questions find an easy response : Genesis is both Steadfast in his resolve and approaches problems internally as a Be-er . <p> The nature of the second question provides ample opportunity for misappropriation of focus and therefore sits without an answer . In The Dark Horse , Genesis appears to solve problems both Linearly and Holistically and therefore this question goes unanswered as well . He appears to be a Linear thinker , but his temperment and disability clouds the answer to this important dynamic question . <p> The four Plot Dynamics focus on the efforts to teach disadvantaged children how to do something positive with their lives : <p> Story Driver Do the efforts to improve the lives of these children progress because Actions force decisions or because Decisions for Actions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these children reach a climax because of a Timelock or an Optionlock ? <p> Story Outcome Do the efforts to improve the lives of these children result in Success or Failure ? <p> Story Judgment Do the efforts to improve the lives of these children appear to be a Good thing or a Bad thing ? <p> All four find easy answers : Actions drive decisions , the story reaches a climax because of a Timelock ( the deadline for the chess tournament ) , and the efforts to improve the lives of these children result in Success and are shown to be a Good thing . <p> With these six questions answered and the Four Throughlines assigned to Domains , Dramatica narrows down the possible storyforms from 32,768 to 128 . <h> The Concerns of Each Throughline <p> After identifying the forces behind the narrative , the analyst now turns their attention towards the Static Plot Points of the story . The first and perhaps most important of these rests at the Plot level of the model and determines the focus of Concern for each Throughline . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses the the Concerns for the other Throughlines : they will locate themselves in the same relative location as the first choice . <p> If the analyst chooses an Overall Story Concern of Obtaining for The Dark Horse , the Main Character Concern would be Innermost Desires , the Influence Character Concern would be The Future , and the Relationship Story Concern would be Changing Ones Nature . Obtaining , Innermost Desires , The Future , and Changing Ones Nature all sit in the bottom left hand corner of the model . <p> If the analyst chose instead an Overall Story Concern of Understanding for The Dark Horse , the Main Character Concern would be Memories , the Influence Character Concern would be The Past , and the Relationship Story Concern would be Developing a Plan . Understanding , Memories , The Past , and Developing a Plan all sit in the upper left hand corner of the model . <p> Narratives rely on focused and meaningful story points to create a comprehensive understanding of the Authors message . Locating these Concerns in the same general location improves the resonancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each Throughline . <p> In The Dark Horse , the Overall Story Concern of Playing Chess finds itself in Doing , the Main Character Concern of Reacting Impulsively finds relevance in Impulsive Responses , the Influence Character Concern of a Body Succumbing to Cancer finds resonance in How Things are Changing , and the Relationship Story Concern of Who Plays What Role in the Family finds a home in Playing a Role . <p> Identifying these Concerns brings the total amount of possible storyforms down to 32 storyforms . <h> From Issues to Concrete Problems <p> Lastly , the analyst looks to the Issues within each Concern and approximates which pair sounds more like the source of conflict within each Throughline . In The Dark Horse , the personal Issues of Genesis belong to either Value &amp; Worth or Worry &amp; Confidence . He seems less troubled by the relative value and worth of things than he does his own anxiety and lack of self-confidence , so Worry &amp; Confidence it is . Between the two , Worry seems the strongest contender for the source of trouble in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the analyst finds Accurate , Result , Process , and Non-Accurate . These four Elements function as the narrative drive within a Throughline : <p> One functions as the true Problem <p> One functions as the Solution to that Problem <p> One looks to be the Symptom of the Problem <p> One functions as the Response to that Symptom <p> For Genesis , Non-Accurate " which in Dramatica means outside of tolerances or inappropriate " looks to be either the Problem or Symptom of his Throughline . Either he sees his inappropriate behavior as a problem ( Symptom ) or his true source of drive eminates from living outside of tolerances . <p> The analyst then checks both options , looking to the other Throughlines for confirmation . By comparing Dramaticas predictions for the other perspectives against the one the analyst feels most strongly about , a greater understanding of the narrative thematics at play begins to materialize . <p> The selection of Non-Accurate as the Main Character Problem resonates clearly in the other Throughlines and leaves the analyst with 2 possible storyforms . <p> The one remaining story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Double-Checking Your Work <p> If a concrete choice still eludes the analyst , they must turn to other areas to help answer this final question . Turning towards the Signposts of each Throughline , one finds that Dramatica narrowed down the 3rd Signpost for Genesis ( what most people consider Act 2b ) to either Innermost Desires or Contemplation . <p> Signpost 3 finds Genesis alone in his van , smashing out the window in a desparate attempt to feel the rain on his hands . The rage that explodes from him identifies completely with Innermost Desires , not Contemplation . <p> By making this choice , the analyst brings the number of possible storyforms down to one . Looking at the Story Engine Settings window , one finds story points in both red and blue . Blue represent choices made by the analyst , red represents what Dramatica predicts the other Throughlines should cover given our selections . <p> A comprehensive examination of those red story points confirms our selections and speaks volumes as to the power of Dramatica to accurately predict a story based on a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrote it magnificently . Dramatica simply predicted what he would write about . <h> The Analyst and the Writer <p> Many think Dramatica a tool for analysis ; something that can and should only be done after the Authors initial draft . By understanding how to accurately analyze a work as amazing as The Dark Horse , the analyst develops their own perception and comprehension of the structure of a functioning narrative . As knowledge grows , so too does intuition . A comprehensive regimen of analysis and action ( writing ) increases the Authors story sense and improves their value both at home and in the story room . <p> After all , the process of rewriting requires an analysis of what is there firstcompetent Authors must be both artist and analyst .

Technically , a smaller resolution exists--the Events within a scene--but for most writers , the Scene is enough . In a theoretically perfect structure , four Scenes exist within a Sequence .

The reason a particular story feels good eliciting that Oh , that 's a great movie reaction is because these points resonate on a frequency that touches upon the way our own minds work . Those looking to communicate effectively with Audiences across the world must understand this narrative code that rests at the foundation of every great story . <p> In Dramatica , a storyform is a unique collection of seventy-plus story points that work together to form a holistic image of the Authors Intent . Authors use competing points-of-view and alternative approaches to solving problems to argue their own points-of-view on the best way to resolve the issues in our lives . For most , this is a hunt-and-seek process that involves several rewrites before the argument begins to take shape . With Dramatica , Authors can identify what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comprehensive structure that helps support that point-of-view . <p> By analyzing a narrative through the eyes of Dramatica " particularly one as comprehensive and meaningful as The Dark Horse " Authors can develop the skills necessary to effectively recognize and appreciate their own storys unique set of story points . The more familiar an Author becomes with a storyform and how each and every part relates , the more comfortable and confident they become when it comes to structuring their own stories . <h> Identifying the Four Throughlines <p> Before diving in to the deep thematics present within each and every scene , the analyst must first identify the Four Throughlines of the story . <p> Narrative drive exists wherever there is an inequity . No imbalance , no story . Yet , one can not focus in on the inequity and simply describe it " the Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao . Instead Authors approximate and speak around the inequity by offering an Audience four different ways of looking at it : <h> Locating the Domain of Conflict for Each Throughline <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Throughlines to a particular Domain , or area , of conflict . In our Universe , conflict can be found in four different arenas : <p> a Situation ( fixed external conflict ) <p> an Activity ( a process of external conflict ) <p> a Fixed Attitude ( fixed internal conflict ) <p> a Manner of thinking ( a process of internal conflict ) <p> In Dramatica , these four areas align into a quad where the external conflict sit on top , and the internal conflicts rest on the bottom . The fixed conflicts find themselves diagonally across from one another as do the processes of conflict . <p> Only one rule when assigning Throughlines to Domains , the following must be diagonally across from each other : <h> Determining Character and Plot Dynamics <p> From there , the analyst begins identifying the answers to dynamic questions that pinpoint the forces that twist and turn the narrative . Dramatica begins with 32,768 possible storyforms . Answering these questions helps narrow down the possibilities and focuses the story engine in on the Authors original intent . <p> The four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does he Change the way he approaches problems or does he Remain Steadfast ? <p> Main Character Growth Does he hold out for something to Start or something to Stop ? <p> Main Character Approach Does he prefer to solve problems externally as a Do-er , or internally as a Be-er ? <p> The first and third questions find an easy response : Genesis is both Steadfast in his resolve and approaches problems internally as a Be-er . <p> The nature of the second question provides ample opportunity for misappropriation of focus and therefore sits without an answer . In The Dark Horse , Genesis appears to solve problems both Linearly and Holistically and therefore this question goes unanswered as well . He appears to be a Linear thinker , but his temperment and disability clouds the answer to this important dynamic question . <p> The four Plot Dynamics focus on the efforts to teach disadvantaged children how to do something positive with their lives : <p> Story Driver Do the efforts to improve the lives of these children progress because Actions force decisions or because Decisions for Actions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these children reach a climax because of a Timelock or an Optionlock ? <p> Story Outcome Do the efforts to improve the lives of these children result in Success or Failure ? <p> Story Judgment Do the efforts to improve the lives of these children appear to be a Good thing or a Bad thing ? <p> All four find easy answers : Actions drive decisions , the story reaches a climax because of a Timelock ( the deadline for the chess tournament ) , and the efforts to improve the lives of these children result in Success and are shown to be a Good thing . <p> With these six questions answered and the Four Throughlines assigned to Domains , Dramatica narrows down the possible storyforms from 32,768 to 128 . <h> The Concerns of Each Throughline <p> After identifying the forces behind the narrative , the analyst now turns their attention towards the Static Plot Points of the story . The first and perhaps most important of these rests at the Plot level of the model and determines the focus of Concern for each Throughline . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses the the Concerns for the other Throughlines : they will locate themselves in the same relative location as the first choice . <p> If the analyst chooses an Overall Story Concern of Obtaining for The Dark Horse , the Main Character Concern would be Innermost Desires , the Influence Character Concern would be The Future , and the Relationship Story Concern would be Changing Ones Nature . Obtaining , Innermost Desires , The Future , and Changing Ones Nature all sit in the bottom left hand corner of the model . <p> If the analyst chose instead an Overall Story Concern of Understanding for The Dark Horse , the Main Character Concern would be Memories , the Influence Character Concern would be The Past , and the Relationship Story Concern would be Developing a Plan . Understanding , Memories , The Past , and Developing a Plan all sit in the upper left hand corner of the model . <p> Narratives rely on focused and meaningful story points to create a comprehensive understanding of the Authors message . Locating these Concerns in the same general location improves the resonancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each Throughline . <p> In The Dark Horse , the Overall Story Concern of Playing Chess finds itself in Doing , the Main Character Concern of Reacting Impulsively finds relevance in Impulsive Responses , the Influence Character Concern of a Body Succumbing to Cancer finds resonance in How Things are Changing , and the Relationship Story Concern of Who Plays What Role in the Family finds a home in Playing a Role . <p> Identifying these Concerns brings the total amount of possible storyforms down to 32 storyforms . <h> From Issues to Concrete Problems <p> Lastly , the analyst looks to the Issues within each Concern and approximates which pair sounds more like the source of conflict within each Throughline . In The Dark Horse , the personal Issues of Genesis belong to either Value &amp; Worth or Worry &amp; Confidence . He seems less troubled by the relative value and worth of things than he does his own anxiety and lack of self-confidence , so Worry &amp; Confidence it is . Between the two , Worry seems the strongest contender for the source of trouble in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the analyst finds Accurate , Result , Process , and Non-Accurate . These four Elements function as the narrative drive within a Throughline : <p> One functions as the true Problem <p> One functions as the Solution to that Problem <p> One looks to be the Symptom of the Problem <p> One functions as the Response to that Symptom <p> For Genesis , Non-Accurate " which in Dramatica means outside of tolerances or inappropriate " looks to be either the Problem or Symptom of his Throughline . Either he sees his inappropriate behavior as a problem ( Symptom ) or his true source of drive eminates from living outside of tolerances . <p> The analyst then checks both options , looking to the other Throughlines for confirmation . By comparing Dramaticas predictions for the other perspectives against the one the analyst feels most strongly about , a greater understanding of the narrative thematics at play begins to materialize . <p> The selection of Non-Accurate as the Main Character Problem resonates clearly in the other Throughlines and leaves the analyst with 2 possible storyforms . <p> The one remaining story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Double-Checking Your Work <p> If a concrete choice still eludes the analyst , they must turn to other areas to help answer this final question . Turning towards the Signposts of each Throughline , one finds that Dramatica narrowed down the 3rd Signpost for Genesis ( what most people consider Act 2b ) to either Innermost Desires or Contemplation . <p> Signpost 3 finds Genesis alone in his van , smashing out the window in a desparate attempt to feel the rain on his hands . The rage that explodes from him identifies completely with Innermost Desires , not Contemplation . <p> By making this choice , the analyst brings the number of possible storyforms down to one . Looking at the Story Engine Settings window , one finds story points in both red and blue . Blue represent choices made by the analyst , red represents what Dramatica predicts the other Throughlines should cover given our selections . <p> A comprehensive examination of those red story points confirms our selections and speaks volumes as to the power of Dramatica to accurately predict a story based on a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrote it magnificently .

As knowledge grows , so too does intuition . A comprehensive regimen of analysis and action ( writing ) increases the Authors story sense and improves their value both at home and in the story room . <p> After all , the process of rewriting requires an analysis of what is there firstcompetent Authors must be both artist and analyst .

Unfortunately , Jake never grew to a point where he could trust in something else ; he never had an opportunity to turn off his own targeting computer .

Complete narratives do more than simply satisfy a laundry list of suggested story pointsthey provide meaning to the seemingly meaningless . <p> Through Influence Character Commandant ( Idris Elba ) we see the impact manipulative adults have on immature minds . The Commandant does this by taking on the role of a great military leader , thinking himself more powerful and more important than he truly is .

Here we experience the conflict that arises from a sort-of hero worship that exists between Agu and the Commandant . Agu clearly sees the Commandant as a potential father figure , and this error in judgment fuels their interplay .

Taking us along for the ride , they a drive a story to its inevitable ending . But what of stories that strive for something more elegant ? <p> Throughout this series on Heroes we have covered learning heroes and teaching heroes , heroes who do n't  change and the difference between what a hero wants and what a hero truly needs . But the one thing we have avoided is the concept of the Hero itself . <h> They 're All The Same <p> There are many entrenched with the notion that Main Character , Protagonist and Hero are interchangeable words . Having lost the will to explore the subtle differences between these concepts of story structure , they throw their hands in the air proclaiming Its all the same to me . Unfortunately , taking this approach robs these terms of any usefulness they may have had in constructing a meaningful story . <p> Building a story necessitates certain tools . Building a strong story necessitates accurate tools . Acting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees a final product that will crumble into another heap of pointless forgotten drivel . <p> If story matters , the tools to build them matter more . <h> Caveats Abound In The Land Of The Hero <p> The definition of Hero : <p> a man of distinguished courage or ability , admired for his brave deeds and noble qualities . <p> a person who , in the opinion of others , has heroic qualities or has performed a heroic act and is regarded as a model or ideal : He was a local hero when he saved the drowning child . <p> These standards become a problem when the character labeled Hero fails to live up to its noble definition . To combat this lack of character , writers ascribe terms like tragic heroes , or anti-heroes , or dark heroes , or whatever perfunctory adjective they can come up with to justify the original definition . Regardless how twisted the terminology may be , the pattern is clear : when you need to clarify what kind of a hero you have in a story , you have effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the introduction of these colors , as many as those in a double rainbow , the word Hero simplifies to simply " who the story is about . " In that case , it might be more accurate to cite this entity as the Main Character . Why bring into question the heroic nature of a character if you do n't  need to ? <p> Needing to attribute the status of Hero to the central character of a story is where the confusion in understanding story structure begins . <h> Heroes That Do n't  Fit the Bill <p> Luke Skywalker was a hero . So was Neo , Kirk and James Bond . William Wallace , George Bailey , Clarice Starling , Bruce Wayne , Paul Rusesabagina , Wikus Van De Merwe , Ree Dolly , Dom Cobb , Amelie , Hiccup , Simba , Woody and Remy claim the status of Hero . No need to tack on an adjective in order to justify their heroic status . <p> But what about Sarah Connor , Scout , Michael Clayton , Columbus , Hauptmann Wiesler , Bernie Lootz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense Animal Kingdom ? Like this second group , J was the central character of the piece , but heroic ? Maybe tragic hero , but again that need to qualify in order to justify appears . <p> What about a character like Rick in Casablanca ? He ended up doing heroic things . Was he like that from the beginning of the story ? Certainly not . He refused to stick his neck out for anyone . As a result , most would adjust his hero status with the term reluctant hero . Having to qualify a concept of story points out the uselessness of it in accurate and meaningful conversation . The reason why one cant call Rick an all-out Hero ? Simplewhile he is the Main Character of the story , he is NOT the Protagonist . <h> Heroes are Both Main Character and Protagonist <p> Reference the first character list above : Luke , Neo , William , George , Clarice , Wikus , and so onall these characters , while certainly what their stories are about , also happen to be the prime movers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of a Protagonist , the one who pursues the successful resolution of the storys problem set into motion by the Inciting Incident . This dual conceit of being the character who the story is about and the one responsible for driving the plot was what they were trying to describe when they coined the term Hero way back when . This need to tack on qualifiers like learning or teaching or reluctant or anti- comes from a lack of awareness that the one who drives the story does not have to be the one who the story is about . <h> If They Do n't Pursue , They Are Not a Hero <p> Michael Clayton is about Michael Clayton , but it is Karen who drives the story . Same with Sarah Connor in The Terminator . She is the Main Character , but it is Reese ( Michael Biehn ) who drives the efforts against the big metal baddie from the future . <p> A similar structure exists with J ( James Frecheville ) in Animal Kingdom . The story centers around his emotional descent as we experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Det . Leckie ( Guy Pearce ) , not J , that we witness a character pursuing a course of action against the disturbed Andrew Pope Cody ( Ben Mendelsohn ) . Joshua still has his resolve tested at the moment of crisisas all Main Characters shouldbut when it comes to resolving the initial problem put into action by Popes return , it is 100% Leckies responsibility from beginning to end . <p> This is why one would never call J as a Hero . Laughable at best to consider calling him this when one takes into account the final outcome and the sophistication with the rest of the story . Tragic Hero would be the term bantered about in film school classrooms , but this would only serve to muddle the conversation and inspire an attitude that all story theory is subjective . A result that would be both defeatist and non-productive . <p> Save the term Hero for the character who pursues the story goal and is the character with which we the audience empathize most with ; the character we the Audience are in the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nagging notions that something is n't right about calling a character a " Hero . " Killing off the qualifiers should be job one for those interested in authentic and meaningful storytelling . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> This concept of splitting the Hero into equal parts Main Character and Protagonist was discovered ( rather uncovered ) by the Dramatica theory of story in the mid-90s of the previous century . The concept is so revolutionary and obvious once grokked that it becomes the gateway drug into learning more about the theory . If this structure paradigm was insightful enough to point out this elegant feature of stories , then surely it must have more to say about what is going on within a story .

The Fibonacci spiral approximates the golden spiral by drawing circular arcs through smaller and smaller squares arranged in an infinite ratio . If story exists as an analogy to the processes within our minds , it only follows that a functioning model of story structure maintain this observable pattern . <p> Previous articles in this series on Plotting Your Story with Dramatica focused on how thematic intent dictates Act structure , and how a writer begins to build tension by establishing a focused and coherent Story Goal . Before exploring how one can dice up the overall tension into finer parts , an understanding of the relationship between story points in Dramatica becomes a necessity . <h> The Infinite Spiral <p> As mentioned in our podcast this week , Episode 32 : Arrival &amp; The Zero-Sum Game , Dramatica is a fractal model . The spatial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or largest resolution , carries down and repeats through each and every level of the model . And even when you reach what you think is the bottom , or smallest resolution , the model loops back onto itself and begins again . How does this work ? <p> Consider the above model of the Dramatica Table of Story Elements ( you might want to download a PDF of the Table of Story Elements to make things easier ) . If you look closely , you will find a quad of elements repeated at each level : Knowledge , Thought , Ability , and Desire ( KTAD ) . These elements repeat because they are the four most important elements in Dramatica ; they repeat because Dramatica is a fractal model of psychology . In fact , every quad in the model above is simply an arrangement of KTAD seen from a different context . <h> The Building Blocks of Dramatica <p> At the very top level you have Situation , Activity , Fixed Attitude , and Manipulation . At first , you might find it difficult to perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the internal model of the Storymind and our external world . <p> Melanie Anne Phillips , co-creator of Dramatica , begins to explain it in her post Dramatica Whered the Idea Come From ? , but in short : Situation is the Knowledge tower , Fixed Attitude is the Thought tower , Activity is the Ability tower , and Psychologyor Manipulationis the Desire tower . As Melanie explains : <p> Knowledge is the Mass of the mind . Thought is the mind 's Energy . Ability is the equivalent of Space and Desire is the counterpart to Time . <p> The top level , or Class level , of the model classifies the source of trouble in each Throughline . A Situation describes conflict stemming from a fixed external problemlike being marooned on a derelict spaceship with a killer alien on board ( Alien ) . In the mind , Knowledge is fixed and has masslike the planets in our solar system . This is why the Knowledge tower holds fixed external problems , or Situations . <p> The same correlation carries through with the other three towers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is why you find it classifying fixed internal problems , or Fixed Attitudes . Zootopia , 12 Angry Men , and To Kill a Mockingbird explore Fixed Attitude problems . <p> Ability describes a process of relating one bit of knowledge to another spatially and determining what is known and unknown , and therefore harbors the external process problems , or Activities . Star Wars , Finding Nemo and The Producers beat about problems of Activity . <p> And finally , Desire describes the process of how thoughtor emotiondevelops over time by comparing what is with what was , and what will bewhich is why you find this tower classifying internal problems of processing , or Psychological issues . Sunset Blvd. , Like Water for Chocolate , and The Incredibles investigate problems arising from how people think . <h> The Different Levels of the Mind <p> Move down to the Type level of the Dramatica Table of Story Elements and KTAD seems hidden once again . Like the golden spiral , the logarithmic function of these four base elements careens down the model hitting different locations at various levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Being , or Playing a Role . Move even further down and you will find KTAD spread throughout the different Classes , but only together in one place ( under Instinct and Understanding in Activity ) . <p> At the Type level you find KTAD centered under Fixed Attitude . Knowledge , Thought , Ability , and Desire disperse into the various levels of the mind itself . <p> Knowledge finds correlation with our Memories , Thought with Contemplations , and Desire with Innermost Desires . Impulsive Responses fill the Ability gap by representing the abilities of the mind to act instinctively or without thought , defining and defined by Memories the way Space defines and is defined by Mass . <p> And you thought story was simply pitting what one character wants against anothers want ! <h> A Model of Relationships <p> The visual of the Fibonacci spiral cascading down through the model of the Dramatic Table of Story Elements is an important one . But it is n't the only fractal relationship within Dramatica . Every single quad within the model shares the same KTAD relationship between its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Take any quad and you will find hints of those four essential building blocks .

It may be difficult to figure out which one represents Knowledge and which one represents Desire , but rest assuredKTAD is there . <p> Locate the Element of Knowledge under Fate and Past within Situation . Do you see it there in the uppermost left hand corner of the model ? Where that Element sits within the model is far more important than the label Chris and Melanie attached to it . That Element actually describes the Knowledge of the Knowledge of the Knowledge of the Knowledge . <p> Dramatica is a model of relationships . And while the fractal relationship stands most apparent in this structural table , an entire system of frictal relationships simultaneously co-exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friction " + " fraction " ) : an iterative pattern representing the temporal interaction of order and chaos as differentiated from fractal ( from " fracture " and " fraction " ) which represents the spatial interaction of order and chaos <p> More on that another time . <h> Looping Back Onto Itself <p> As mentioned in the article Writing a Perfectly Structured Scene With Dramatica , the fractal nature of Dramatica does not stop at the bottom . The dramatic circuit represented by KTAD breaks the events in a Scene down into a Situation , an Activity , a Fixed Attitude , and a Way of Thinking ( or Manipulation ) . <p> With the understanding of Dramatica as a fractal ( and now frictal ) model in mind , our attention returns to using the theory to plot out a story . In our next article , we will show how this model of structural &amp; dynamic relationships makes it easy to break down the dramatic tension of a story into smaller and smaller parts . <p> Past is Knowledge , Present is Thought , How Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? ?

But taken as a whole , both these films leave one feeling strangely empty as the credits roll . When given an option on a Friday night between Brad Pitts Nazi scalper or Al Pacinos Michael Corleone , most lovers of story would choose the latter . Both feature charismatic actors , yet only one delivers the story . Dramatica explains why . <p> Yet , this explanation comes with a cost .

But as an infamous group of cybernetic organisms will one day tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Too Complicated <p> The only reason anyone has had trouble answering the questions posed by the theory is because there were significant inconsistencies with the story they were trying to tell . If you spend enough time with the theory and make the effort to really understand what it is trying to say , you start to realize that the reason great stories work out so well ( Hamlet , Godfather , Chinatown , Shawshank Redemption , Casablanca ) , is because they had these inconsistencies worked out . Dramatica points out the errors with your thinking . <h> But It Looks Like The Same Old Paradigm <p> Many recognize the difference between what the Protagonist wants and what he or she really needs . Dramatica shines by explaining exactly why this dynamic exists and why a character would be so focused on their wants when focusing on their needs would really satisfy the problems in their lives . Other paradigms recognize the pattern , yet offer little in terms of understanding why . In addition , the theory forces a writer to decide what kind of ending they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say with their story . These are good things . <h> I Do n't  Know Anyone Who Uses Dramatica <p> Every writer has his or her own personal blind spots . It is what drives them to write , compelling them with the need to say something worthwhile . Many writers do n't  like Dramatica because it points out their blind spots . Unfortunately for them , that is the main purpose of the theory . It says to writers , " Look , you 're not perfect , you 're actually missing an entire side to the argument you are trying to make , and if you leave it out the audience is going to call you out on it ( by not going to see your movie ) .

It does not dictate style , pacing , or narrative ( linear or non-linear ) . These highly subjective elements of writing are left up to the artist - the way it should be . When helping authors achieve rock-solid story structure , I always make a point of first understanding what it is the individual artist is trying to say with their work . Only then can I accurately apply the theoretical concepts behind Dramatica to their work . It is an objective approach to constructing a story that many are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctboth heavily subjective in nature . Opinion and the specifics of creative expression should be left in the hands of the artist . It is the construction of a meaningful argument that always requires assistance . <p> It is surprising how so many consider Dramatica formulaic or by-the-book storytelling when it makes great efforts to free writers from the creative shackles imposed by Field , McKee and Snyder . Unlike Snyder who dictates that one has to have a " Dark Night of the Soul " moment or that the " Final Image " must be directly related to the " Opening Image , " Dramatica leaves the particulars of how a story should be presented up to the creativity of the author . Structure does not dictate how a story should be delivered , only that it be delivered completely . <p> Dramatica accounts for all these previous paradigms and moves on to tell you , " You know what ?

The ending may not be what weve come to expect , but the beats and choices that many of the characters make are familiar territory for fans of romantic fare . This becomes less of a problem and more of a strength when you consider the non-linear approach to weaving the individual throughlines .

It may end in disaster or blossom into something new . The relationship is exciting in its possibilities . <p> Many writers new to the theory think this Relationship Throughline is an area where the two principal characters argue over the best way to solve the main storys problem .

In other words , do n't  do it . <p> In fact , you can write a Relationship Throughline where the two principals barely share any scene time together .

Their relationship as husband and wife comes into conflict over Bobs " cheating " activities . His going out and engaging in superhero antics creates a strain on their relationship and in their marriage .

Regardless of the type of story , each throughlineOverall Story , Main Character , Influence Character and Relationship Storyreceived an equal and appropriate amount of attention . Yet in doing so one throughline in particular , the most important in terms of capturing the attention of an audience , managed to escape the analysis with one important aspect overlooked . <p> Main Characters can suffer from deficient ways of thinking , like Red in The Shawshank Redemption and Hamlet in Hamlet ( as covered in Exotic Story Structure Often Unexplored ) . Others can face challenges with their physicality or their station in life ( Wikus Van De Merwe in District 9 or Mike Flaherty in Win Win ) .

The Empire in Star Wars and Destroying the Ring in The Lord of the Rings ) and stories where individual relationships focus on the same ( Lester and Ricky in American Beauty ) , stories that focus the problematic activity on the most personal of throughlines take on a different personality . William Wallace in Braveheart , Woody in the first Toy Story , and Hogarth in The Iron Giant serve as excellent examples of Main Characters who face trouble because of what they do . <h> Characters Who Ca n't Help Themselves <p> Wallace finds conflict not in the way he appears ( Situation ) , not in what he thinks ( Fixed Attitude ) or even how he thinks ( Psychology ) , but rather in the things he does ( Activities ) . Seeking revenge on his wifes murderer , plundering English forts and stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the actions he takes . <p> Same with Hogarth Hughes in The Iron Giant . His sense of adventure and his natural desire to collect stray creatures ( both organic and mineral ) defines his character and the type of conflict the audience can expect from his personal Throughline . That optimistic drive to do ? Thats Hogarth through and through . <p> Understanding that the Influence Characters Throughline sits directly across from the Main Character on the structural chart puts the Iron Giant himself in a Problematic Way of Thinking or deficient psychology . Locked in a constant struggle of who he is and what he should be , the Giant reflects Hogarths adventurous spirit in his own internal quest . The two bounce off each otherone external , one internaluntil the end , when the Giant must finally take that step into the external and finally take some action . <p> But what about those Main Characters who suffer from a lack of action ? <h> Why Wont Anyone Play With Me ? <p> Woodys throughline offers an excellent opportunity to expand on this idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogarth , its not so much the things Woody does that creates problems for him ( though he does tend to jump into things quickly , calling meetings , getting into fights , etc. ) , as it is the lack of someone playing with him . <p> An interesting facet of these areas of conflict lies in the fact that they can either be problems engaged in or problems attributed to the Throughline in question . Remember that a Main Character in the Fixed Attitude corner of the structural chart can either suffer from a bad mindset ( Scrooge in A Christmas Carol ) or have others think badly of him ( William Munny in Unforgiven ) . Either way satisfies the definition of a conflict stemming from problematic mindsets . Again , it is the purpose behind the throughline that is more important than its portrayal . <p> With Woody , an audience becomes personally familiar with the plight of someone not engaging in " playtime .

This unique quality , separate from the story-wide problem found in the Overall Story Throughline or the relational conflict found in the Relationship Throughline , draws an audience into a story . Without this unique perspective on conflict and the struggle to resolve it , the audience sits apart from the work in question , unable to emotionally invest themselves in the events on-screen or in type . <h> Stories That Fail to Engage <p> Consider recent emotionally-bereft pieces like Captain America . This latest disaster from Marvel had the best of intentions with its dork-to-champ story , yet for some reason tossed this personal throughline aside to focus on the silly tale of a red-masked Nazi and his super-weapon .

Regardless , an audience needs personal conflict in order to become engaged with a story . <p> Other vacant emotional tales ? Fast Five . The writers did n't  even try , leaving this Summer dud one boring race car sequence after the next . Transformers : Dark of the Moon ? Like Captain Americas hero , at least Witwicki started out with some personal turmoil . True , Sam was only looking for a job , but at least it gave the audience something !

The fights were exciting , but without a well-defined personal conflict there was little reason to care or become emotionally invested . <h> Looking for Someone like Us <p> Is it perhaps reductive to isolate a Main Characters Throughline to only one area of conflict ? Not if one understands the purpose of a throughline in defining the personality of a story . Effective stories reflect the problem-solving process of the human mind .

Reading about Ben Hogans golf game and Benjamin Franklins writing exercises made me want to find something similar for developing our writers intuition . <p> He offers some clues : <p> Mindless activity is the enemy of deliberate practice . The danger of practicing the same thing again and again is that progress becomes assumed . Too often , we assume we are getting better simply because we are gaining experience . In reality , we are merely reinforcing our current habits " not improving them . <p> But still , how do you practice something you only turn to once in awhile or at the beginning of a project ? <p> Then it occurred to meI already did create a program of deliberate practice : <p> The second effective feedback system is coaching .

Good coaches can track your progress , find small ways to improve , and hold you accountable to delivering your best effort each day . <p> With the Dramatica Mentorship Program , I coach writers in the deliberate practice of writing and rewriting story encoding for various story points . The centerpiece of this program are the Playground Exercisestasks that force a writer past mindless writing and using Dramatica as storytelling into an area where they begin to see story points as sources of conflict . By holding each and every writer accountable to truly using Dramatica to its ultimate potential , we develop an instinct for maximizing scene potential . <h> Writers Who Avoid Conflict <p> Believe it or not , some writers steer clear of conflict in their pursuit of their craft . Justin Wills , one of our writers under the program , had this to say recently about the practice of the Playgrounds : <p> this is helpful . one of the issues I am starting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which stifles my creativity and limits my writing . Its like Im trying to get the right answer and in doing so i keep everything small and on the surface . I can see how these exercises can help me break that " safe " pattern <p> I wonder if it stems from peoples basic desire in their own lives to avoid it . <p> A salient and thought-provoking point . Writing is often thought to be a form of self-therapy . Avoiding the identification and acceptance of conflict in ones own work often signals the same behavior in ones personal life . <p> I feel like if I can get past this it will open my writing way up <p> Definitely . After coaching writers for two years with these exercises I can tell you that every last student emerges free and clear of superficial and mindless writing . <h> A Chance to Develop Your Skills <p> The Dramatica Mentorship Program currently runs $650/month .

As our clientele grows so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program and previous students can expect their rates to stay the same . <p> Many writers new to Dramatica think they understand how it works . They see a Main Character Concern of The Future and think Yeah , my character is concerned about the way things will be . They see an Influence Character Problem of Ending and think Yes , that Character wants things to stop . Those same writers do n't  understand that these story points must be sources of conflict ; concerns of the Future often lead characters to neglect present day responsibilities , problems of Ending often show up in terminating valuable projects long before they have had a chance to germinate . <p> A Dramatica " coach " , or Mentor , can keep you on track and help you develop your own writers intuition far beyond your limiting blind spots . They can make you aware of conflict-deficient scenes and offer tools and techniques designed to bring the very best out of you . In short , the Dramatica Mentorship Program provides a haven of deliberate practice for writers who wish to be deliberate with their craft .

Whether purposeful or not , the refusal to let us in on what Jobs is personally feeling or experiencing makes it impossible for us to empathize with the films events . <p> The Main Character is our personal first-person perspective into a narrative . Each Throughline represents a different point-of-view on the storys central inequity . While the Overall Story Throughline covers the They perspective , the Influence Character Throughline the You perspective , and the Relationship Story Throughline the We perspective , the Main Character Throughline covers the I perspective .

Time to call your main Character home and set him to the task of illustrating your story .

That uniqueness , that " fun " that you had illustrating those Gists ? Try and keep the integrity of your words when it comes to folding them back into your story . <p> If you still cant find one that rings out , try taking bits and parts from different Playgrounds and mix them together . I 've taken the thematic " meat " as it were from one story ( the Domain down to the Solution ) and mixed it with the Benchmark from another and the Signposts from two other stories . Because I 've generated so much story material to work from , an embarassment of riches awaits from which to pluck out the rarest and most exhilarating gems . <p> More often than not you 'll find the perfect story that only requires changing the name , maybe the gender association , and that 's it . That has usually been my experience . Other times you 'll have to do more and mix and match as I have described . The important part is maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Dramatica made it possible for you to forget about the structure and simply have fun writing and it will show in ways that should shock and surprise you .

You 'll know what issues he will be dealing with , the kinds of things he will be doing to avoid dealing with his real problems , and you 'll know how it all works out for him in the end . Along the way you 'll have a good measuring stick to determine his progress ( the Benchmark ) and you 'll have landmark-sized destinations for his emotional journey that you should hit along the way ( the Signposts ) .

The other Throughlinesthe Overall Story , the Influence Character and the Relationship Story Throughlinesall have their own unique spins on the Playground exercise . Understanding what these Throughlines represent makes clear the difference : different perspectives require different contexts and different contexts necessitate different interpretations . <h> The Influence Character Playground <p> When it comes to the Influence Character Throughline you 'll want to focus on their influence or impact on others . Too many times those new to Dramatica simply write that Throughline as another Main Character . The Influence Character only exists as a challenge to the Main Characters way of doing things , so write that difference .

Write the Signposts and feel where you think their relationship will end up . As of now , Dramatica supplies no indication as to whether or not the Relationship Throughline resolves , so you 'll have to rely on your instincts for that answer . If you cant definitively choose one way or another , do both and see which one speaks to you more . <h> The Overall Story Playground <p> You may wish to skip the Playground on this one .

Far too often writers find themselves trapped writing and rewriting the perfect tree . The Main Character Playground exercise , and its accompanying brothers and sisters in the other Throughlines , frees writers from their own self-imposed limits and grants them an opportunity at creating something truly wonderful and unique .

Seen by many as an indication of " refusing the call to adventure " , this unwillingness on the part of the central character to participate seemingly correlates with a key story point in Dramatica . Unfortunately , this similarity exists only in semantics and if left unexplained could lead to confusion and a misappropriation of narrative focus . <p> In short , the simplicity and subjective nature of the Heros Journey finds no correlation in the complex and sublimely sophisticated theory of story known as Dramatica . <h> The Objective Viewpoint of Dramatica <p> The process of using the Dramatica theory of story to frame a narrative is often foreign and uncomfortable . Most writers become writers because they enjoy placing themselves in the shoes of the characters and writing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of being someone else and working through their issues and problems draws certain artists in and turns them into writers . <p> Dramatica wants you , the writer , to look at your story as this thing , this object you hold in your hands . Dramatica wants you to look at your story from the outside , not the inside . Removed from the emotion and subjectivity of being within , you answer questions and determine story points from an objectified point-of-view . While certainly devoid of sexiness and passion , this vantage point helps you detect holes within the narrative that you cant see from the inside . <p> Does the Main Character act like someone who prefers to solve problems externally before internally ? Does the story reach a climax because options run out or because time runs out ? Does the Main Character end the story completely resolved of their angst , or is there something still digging at them deep inside ? <p> Writing from the Main Characters point-of-view , an Author might be tempted to lie to himself or herself as the characterand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why it is such a powerful tool when it comes to refining the craft of writing . An objective point-of-view saves writers from themselves . <h> The Audiences Point-of-View of a Story <p> The last two weeks found us diving into what Dramatica refers to as Audience Appreciations . By combining certain key dynamic and objective story points together , we found that a writer can pierce the veil that lies between Author and Audience and predict subjectively how the Audience will receive and react to the story . In short , by understanding and employing these story points , writers can predict how an Audience will appreciate their work . <p> And if they can predict how an Audience will behave based on key story points , they can also reverse the process and determine their narrative based on the Audience behavior desired . <p> In this article , we intend to continue our discussion on these Audience Appreciations by focusing on the third in this series of four : the Audience Appreciation of Tendency . <h> Not a Refusal of the Call <p> The Dramatica theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Main Character feels compelled to accept the quest . Not all Main Characters are well suited to solve the problem in their story . They may possess the crucial element essential to the solution yet not possess experience in using the tools needed to bring it into play . <p> Seasoned writers may attribute this story point to the " Refusal of the Call " sequence found in the Heros Journey narrative pattern . <p> And they would be wrong . <p> Brought into greater public awareness during the 20th century by Joseph Campbell and made popular by many more in search of a grand narrative code , the Heros Journey " structure " attempts to overlay a spiritual , or transformational , growth sequence to every narrative . The Heros Journey is given to gross inaccuracies and rampant generalizations in no small part due to its inherent position from within the story . Those blind spots mentioned above ? This is where the Heros Journey and its subjective nature fail to capture the true nature of a narrative . <p> Instead , the Main Characters impetus to participate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and the specific type of plot points that drive the story forward . <h> The Main Characters Approach <p> Some Main Characters prefer to solve problems externally first , while others prefer to change themselves internally first . Main Characters can and do both , but they will always defer to one over the other as they work through a narrative . The Main Character Approach sees the primary character within a narrative falling into one of two places : either a Do-er or a Be-er . <p> The reason for the preference lies in the way the human mind operates : when we sense a problem we simultaneously define where we believe the solution to be.1Problems do not exist without solutions in the same way that black does not exist without white . The location of that perceived solution is always in the same general area as the problem that motivates us to engage in problem-solving . If we experience an external problem , our preference is to solve it externally first . If we experience an internal problem , our first approach is to solve it internally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Braveheartnot a whole lot of considering going on there . Wallace would struggle to understand Hamlets constant need to overthink things , and vice versa ; Wallaces impulse to jump in and lop off heads would appal the Great Danes sense of contemplation . Wallace witnesses a lack of proaction as problematic , and engages in wholesale violence to amend it . <p> Look at Tre ( Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) in Boyz N the Hood or Ned ( William Hurt ) in Body Heat . Getting out of the hood and addressing ones lust for a married woman require physical external approaches . You do n't  plan on getting out , or getting in " as the case may beby thinking and changing yourself first . <p> You can , however , if you 're Mark Zuckerberg ( Jesse Eisenberg ) in The Social Network or Todd Anderson ( Ethan Hawke ) in Dead Poets Society . Surviving a hurtful deposition by doubling down on your willful charisma and hiding ones shyness while attending an elite prep boarding school call for internal shifts of character . <p> Seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sampling of internal Be-ers may seem incongruous at first " until one takes the time to truly reflect on his personal issue within that story . Yes , he drives the story forward externally as the Protagonist , but his personal issues lie deep within the internal realm and what other people think of him . <p> The Main Character Approach " and therefore the Tendency of a Main Character to participate or " refuse " to join the call to adventurefocuses solely on the personal issues of the Main Character . Yet another in a long line of reasons why the Heros Journey fails to be sufficient enough for describing the building blocks of a narrative . <h> The Story Driver <p> In addition to their familiarity with the inept " Refusal of the Call " , many writers also understand the presence of several key plot points that drive a story forward . Often beginning with an Inciting Incident , transgressing through a First Act Turn , a Midpoint , and a Second Act Turn , and ending with a Concluding Event , narratives naturally self-divide into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these four units of dramatic development define the beginning , middles , and end of a story . <p> Dramatica goes one step futher with this recognition of division by defining the type of plot point that turns a story from one Act into the next . In fact , in order for a narrative to function correctly each and every plot point needs to be of the same type : either all Actions or all Decisions , and with each forcing instances of the other . Actions force Decisions or Decisions force Actions . These Story Drivers clue the Audience in on the kind of work needed to progress through the narrative.2 <p> Short Term 12 , Pitch Perfect , Inside Out , and Big all require Action to push the narrative forward . Dealing with troubled teens " whether in a facility , a singing competition , or just one trapped in an adult body " requires external action to accomplish anything . Even working through the internal workings of a teenage mind calls for Joy and Sadness to engage in physical activity in Inside Out . Trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rileys complete psychological breakdown . <p> Action is not the only way to work through a narrative . Sometimes , the narrative potential of a story slowly diminishes as actions continue to be taken " until someone makes a major deicision and the conflict flares up again . These stories require decisions to push the narrative forward . <p> Deciding to undercut your crops , deciding to leave with a crazed gunman , deciding to leave the ghost world to help a choking kid , and deciding to follow ghosts into a cornfield " the major plot points of Field of Dreams resuscitate the narrative drive from one Act into the next by making decisions that force actions to be taken . <p> Same with Crazy , Stupid , Love . Typically a narrative focused on divorce sees adulterous Action as the instigator for deciding to part ways . Here , Cal ( Steve Carell ) faces a narrative with Decision driving the action . In order to work his way through the process he must decide how to dress , decide who to date , and ultimately decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the one and only one for him . <p> Turns out a narrative initiated by a Decision requires a decision to wrap it all up . This happens because a story is not simply a confluence of intriguing characters and rising tension . Rather , story functions the way it does because it represents a complex model of the human mind at work . <p> Plot points have to be all the same type because that is how we think through problems . <h> A Model of the Storymind <p> Dramatica sees a story as a model of a single human mind working to solve an inequity . This model " while exploded out over two hours in a film or 600+ pages in a novel " theoretically happens in an instance . This is why the Story Drivers fall into either being all Actions or all Decisions : A story models resolution of a specific external or internal conflict . While the mind experiences several billion internal and external narratives a day , a single narrative can only model one or the other . <h> Willing to Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for solving problems with the work required to drive a narrative forward towards resolution and you find two categories of Main Characters : those Willing to do the work necessary , and those Unwilling to do the work . <p> While Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamil ) certainly " refuses the call " , he absolutely is Willing to take the Action . His personal issues lie in an external situation he would Do anything to overcome . Stuck on one side of the galaxy while his friends experience all the fun on the other side requires him to take action to get off the planet . It just so happens fighting an Empire requires the same . Put them together and you have a Willing Main Character . <p> Same with Woody ( Tom Hanks ) in Toy Story , Joe ( William Holden ) in Sunset Boulevard , and Clarice ( Jodie Foster ) in The Silence of the Lambs . Playing with your best friend , writing screenplays , and saving those screaming lambs necessitate taking Action " the same process that gets you back home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killer . If the story calls for an event for which your Main Character is perfectly suited for , they will willingly participate . <p> What about Be-ers in a Decision story ? Living under oppression often requires one to adapt themselves to environment ; rarely does taking action result in the same progress seen above . The decisions made while under state rule often signify the difference between life and death . <p> In The Lives of Others and The Counterfeiters both Cpt . Weisler ( Ulrich M++he ) and Salomon Sorowitsch ( Karl Markovics ) find themselves faced with conflict driven by the decisions of men in power . Thankfully , they both understand where this conflict originates due to their familiarity with internal pressure . Weisler personally suffers from a low opinion of himself brought about by living in East Germany . Likewise , Salomon suffers from a psychology bent on survival at any cost " regarldess of the choices one has to make . <h> Unwilling to Work Through the Narrative <p> It is when we turn to examples of Unwilling Main Characters that the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kimball ( Harrison Ford ) from The Fugitive is unwilling to participate in the clearing of his own name ? Detective Jake Gittes ( Jack Nicholson ) in Chinatown engages unwillingly in the investigation behind the murder of Hollis Mulwray ? <p> Those do n't  sound remotely correct . <p> Tre from Boyz N the Hood ? Lester from American Beauty ? Rocky Balboa ? He s an unwilling character too ? ? <p> These only account for the Do-ers in Decision stories . Perhaps the Be-ers in Action stories will feel more Unwilling : <p> Chris Kyle ( Bradley Cooper ) from American Sniper ? ! If there ever was a more willing character , he would be ithe went back three times ! Becca ( Anna Kendrick ) from Pitch Perfect feels a little more closer to unwilling , but really it feels more like she is resistant to the narrative rather than unwilling . She wants to sing in the competition . <p> As with last weeks investigation of the Audience Appreciation of Nature , perhaps Chris and Melanie mislabeled the semantic values for Tendency . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative as a model of a single human trying to solve a problem . And then refer back to last weeks explanation of this model as already having time factored in : <p> Remember that the storyform has time built into it . Though it may look like a single set of story points defining the state of things , it simultaneously delineates the passage of time through the mental processes of a single human mind solving a problem . <p> When reading the Tendency of the Main Character , what the Audience is really seeing is the resistance or flow of the Main Characters personal issues within the dramatic circuit of the narrative . Some Main Characters gum up the works with their personal problems , while others help facilitate the flow of conflict resolution . <h> A Build Up of Resistance <p> With this in mind , one can now see how an Audience might appreciate the resistance Dr. Richard Kimball or Jake Gittes brings to the dramatic circuit of their narratives . Kimball hampers resolution with his constant need to prove his innocence . Gittes mucks everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  belong ( literally ) . <p> Same with Chris in American Sniper , Cage in Edge of Tomorrow , and even Jason Bourne in the original The Bourne Identity . The very presence of their personal issues creates a blockage within their respective stories . <p> What then of the Willing Main Characters ? <h> A Tendency Towards Flow <p> Looking back we can see Woody , Joe , and Clarice as facilitating the flow of dramatic resolution . If it werent for their personal issues , their stories would not have circulated quite as easily . Same with Weisler , Sorowitsch , and Skywalker . Their narratives surged smoothly because of the way each had grown accustomed to dealing with their own personal problems . <h> The Dramatic Circuit of a Narrative <p> More than " refusing a call " , a Main Characters Unwillingness to participate in a narrative results in a greater resistance and dramatic buildup to any potential conflict . Conversely , a Willingness to do what is needed facilitates flow and circulation of that potential . <p> Regardless of nomenclature , the very idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a narrative should be seen as a monumental achievement towards a better understanding of story . By allowing Authors to remove themselves from the equation , the Dramatica theory of story makes it possible to establish the resistance or flow of dramatic conflict throughout a narrative . By seeing this current as a function of personal issues multiplied by dynamic progression , a writer appreciates how the Audience will respond and can adjust the narrative accordingly . <p> Dramatica truly is a call to action . By refusing this call to understand story with greater precision and higher accuracy , the writer unwittingly places themselves in the role of the tragic Hero . <p> And that is no journey any Artist should suffer through . <p> Really , we create problems in our minds as a means of the problem-solving process .

From there they found the reason for characters , the reason for plot , the reason for theme , and the reason for a whole host of other conceptual items present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , story as a model of the human mind , that gives writers a truly accurate understanding of story structure . <h> Analogies That Miss The Point <p> In contrast , Mr. Mandells analogy of the wine glass as structure only serves to confuse the issue . To summarize , Mandells contention is that the wine is the " story " , while the glass itself is structure . Those who are wine-driven eschew story structure formulas to focus on the best part of writing : <p> the wine is the reason we all want to be writers . The wine is our characters , dialogue , subtext , themes and emotional connections . It is what makes stories memorable and meaningful . It is why we go to the movies . <p> That sounds nice . And reasonably accurate . The analogy continues , pointing out that story structure templates such as Save the Cat ! mistakingly focus their attention on the glass . <p> The job of structure is to contain this wine in an appropriately designed vessel to allow the reader/viewer to fully experience and enjoy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend not to notice it . But when it does n't do its job , we are n't able to fully experience and appreciate the wine . <p> This is where the analogy breaks down . <p> Structure does not " contain " a story . Structure is not a delivery system for wine . Structure is the arrangement of ingredients that went into the wine . The amount of grapes , yeast , and sugar , the process of flavor extraction , fermentation , and bottlingthese represent true story structure within the wine-as-story analogy . <p> The key difference between Dramaticas understanding of story structure and that of Mandell , Snyder , and everyone before them ? Intent . The Authors purpose for writing their story . <p> To return to the analogy of the wine and the glass , what does the vintner hope to accomplish by producing this wine ? Certainly , the production of the glass is of little concern to him in the same way that Authors have little control over the venue or sound system . But this is n't structure . However , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the particular flavor , aroma , characteristic and sensation they wanted to infuse into their wine . <p> Structure is meaning , and Dramatica can help with that . <h> Questions That Promote Deeper Thinking <p> Perhaps one of the strongest aspects of Dramatica is its ability to make Authors think deeper about their stories . The anonymous Screenwriting Screenwriter had this to say recently about the theory : <p> I 'm sure a lot of people try out Dramatica briefly , get frustrated just as I have , and then discard it forever . I can almost guarantee you , it was n't Dramaticas fault . It is not mad libs ; it demands a lot of a writer to use it properly . And if its not giving you the answers you want , you really need to stop and examine why that is . It will be worth it . <p> The only writers who do n't  like Dramatica either do n't  understand it , or have nothing to say . For those in the first group ( because , those in the second are n't  worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of the films Mr. Mandell pointed to as not following a " formula " and run them through a couple of Dramaticas questions . <h> Main Character Resolve <p> The first of these questions simply asks if the central character of the story changes their approach towards solving problems . If they do , they are Change Main Characters . If they do n't  , then they are Steadfast Main Characters . Note that this has nothing to do with a characters " arc . " Many become confused with the suggestion that there are Main Characters who do n't  change . An understanding of What Character Arc Really Means should easily clear that up . <p> The answer to this question of resolve primes the engine of a story , setting the potential for the storys ultimate meaning . <p> In The Godfather , Michael ( Al Pacino ) changes the way he approaches problems . In the beginning he has no problem explaining the family business to Kaye . At the end , he lies to her face about it . He changes from a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven by the cold-hearted logic necessary to keep his family business alive . <p> Interestingly enough , When Harry Met Sally takes its Main Character in the exact opposite direction . Harry ( Billy Crystal ) begins the story driven by the simple logic that men and women can not be both friends and lovers . Eventually , he changes his approach and listens to his heart . <p> That seems easy enough , and perhaps a little obvious . So why then is the answer to this question so important ? Because , when combined with the next two questions , it gives a clue as to what the Author was trying to say through their story . <h> Story Outcome , Judgment and Meaningful Endings <p> As covered in the series of articles on Meaningful Endings , the outcome of the Protagonists efforts to resolve the story problem combines with the emotional state of the Main Character to identify the type of story one is telling . <p> Dramatica refers to these two facets of meaningful story endings as the Story Outcome and the Story Judgment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in Success or Failure . The Story Judgment makes a value judgment on the storys impact on the Main Characters personal issues . If he is still angst-ridden , then the Judgment is Bad . If he has overcome his personal issues , then the Judgment is Good . <p> If things work out and the Main Character goes home happy , the story is a Triumph ( Success/Good ) . If they work out , but the Main Character is still angst-ridden , the story is a Personal Tragedy ( Success/Bad ) . If the efforts to resolve the storys problem fail , yet the Main Character feels good about it , then the story is a Personal Triumph ( Failure/Good ) . And lastly , if things do n't  work out and the Main Character feels awful , the story is a Tragedy ( Failure/Bad and hello , Hamlet ) . <p> Out of these four possible endings , When Harry Met Sally is clearly a Triumph story . Sally and Harry marry and Harry himself feels pretty good about it . Tying this in with Harrys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you look at relationships with logic , you will only find success and happiness by changing that approach and replacing it with your feelings . <p> Its not Earth-shattering , but it is what the filmexcuse me storyis trying to say . <p> What about The Godfather ? <p> Michael changes and the power structure of New Yorks underground is preserved . But where is he emotionally ? Not exactly jumping up and down with joy . He still has issues with his involvement with the mafia , made clear by his need to keep it a secret from Kaye . The meaning behind the story is equally as clear : Replacing feeling with logic may give you success in the larger scheme of things , but you 'll lose your soul in the process . <p> That scene of the door closing on Michael is so cool because it means something . We have broken down the components here , but during the experience of the film one appreciates that meaning subconsciously . The Audience synthesizes the Authors intended meaning . <h> The Power of Complete Stories <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple statements . As Hollywood movie-mogul Peter Guber recently said in an article for Psychology Today : <p> without stories not only would we not likely have survived as a species , we could n't understand ourselves . They provoke our memory and give us the framework for much of our understanding . They also reflect the way the brain works . While we think of stories as fluff , accessories to information , something extraneous to real work , they turn out to be the cornerstone of consciousness . <p> Complete stories have the intent of arguing if a particular approach to solving problems is appropriate or not . They are tools for survival . While it is true that the more popular and easily accessible interpretations of story structure ignore this fact , the Dramatica theory uses it as a foundation to develop a fascinating insight into the forces behind effective storytelling . 
@@119273187 @8273187/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Concepts <p> These are those huge chunks of narrative Aristotle uncovered way back when . Though he said there were only three--beginning , middle , and end--when in reality the structure of the story dictates the number of Acts in a work . Two Acts . Three Acts . Four Acts . It all depends on other dynamic factors and could be different across different Throughlines . Thankfully , Dramatica figures it all out for us so we can concentrate on writing the story our heart tells us to write . <p> This is the character who works to Prevent the Protagonist from winning . Couple this motivation with a penchant for getting people to Reconsider and you have the workings of a classic Antagonist . Give them the Influence Character role and suddenly you have the makings of a classic Villain ( think the Joker in The Dark Knight ) . And no , James Bond is NOT the Antagonist no matter what someone tells you , it just does n't play out . <p> Everyone thinks Archetypes represent some sort of aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Doorstop , and the Gateway Guardian . They do n't . Archetypes function as analagoies to forces and drives within our own minds . The Protagonist represents our tendency towards Initiating action . The Antagonist represents Reticence within the mind . Once you see characters as parts of a Story Mind these other names seem silly and made-up . <p> " Everything before the Forestory--or what most people just call the story . This is where Justifications are built and Problems begin . If you want to know why a character is motivated to do what they do , you 'll find the answer in here . There is nothing wrong with Backstory--in fact , you kinda need it . But you need a sophisticated way to present it without someone standing there explaining it all . <p> In any awesome story , one of the principal characters will do a complete 180 on what they believe while the other principal will stand their ground . If the Main Character flips their perspective , the Influence Character will remain steadfast . If the Influence Character flips--or has their perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This concept explores the latter situation wherein the Influence Character adopts the Main Character 's point-of-view . <p> In any awesome story , one of the principal characters will do a complete 180 on what they believe while the other principal will stand their ground . If the Main Character flips their perspective , the Influence Character will remain steadfast . If the Influence Character flips--or has their perspective Changed , then the Main Character will remain steadfast . This concept explores the former situation wherein the Main Character adopts the Influence Character 's point-of-view . <p> In Dramatica , Character can be found at the Element level . This is where you will find the Motivations , Methodolgies , Evaluations , and Purposes of the Story Mind . Some characters act as objectified versions of forces and influences while others act as subjective points-of-view held within the mind . Once you stop seeing them as " real " people and start seeing them as individual parts of one whole , you will start to understand how to write better characters . <p> This is how a character changes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is part of it , but Dramatica looks deeper into that change and explains in detail all the components that make up that " change " . First you have your Resolve which tells whether or not they grow into their point-of-view or grow out of their point-of-view . And then you have their Growth which explains if they grow by dropping an unwanted characteristic or by grabbing a new one . Combine the two together and you have what most people commonly refer to as Character Arc . <p> You know the characters in your story , but do you know what they are actually made up of ? Who is driven by Faith . By Temptation . By Support or Pursuit or Avoid or driven to Hinder ? Who is Proactive ? Reactive ? Inactive ? Who Trusts ? Tests ? Tries to Prove their point or Expects the worst from others ? Who seeks out how things Actually are and who would rather examine their own Perceptions or look for greater Knowledge or Chaos ? Do you have any characters who share the same elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise they will come across as redundant and ineffective . <p> You have likely heard of the Inciting Incident of a story , but have you ever considered the Closing Event ? Dramatica really does n't even refer to the beginning and end of a story in this sort of subjective viewpoint . Instead it looks to the Story Drivers to see what forces begin the inequity of a story , and what bring them to some kind of resolution . You need to know both ends of your story in order for it all to make sense . <p> Want to write a story that everyone will love ? Want to make sure you do n't have any story holes ? Then you are going to have to learn how to write a complete story . In Dramatica this is easily done by making sure you cover all the Four Throughlines needed to make a complete argument . Main Character , Influence Character , Relationship Story , and Overall Story . Cover all those bases and you will have a complete and fulfilling story . <p> Everyone wants a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not necessarily . Some would rather spend their time on settings and entertaining action sequences and for them , we have Archetypal Characters . But for everyone else we have Complex Characters . Take what is the expected set of character elements that work together for a certain aspect within the Story Mind and mix them up . That 's a Complex Character . <p> The Concern of a Throughline can often be seen as the Goal of that Throughline . In fact , if you look closely enough you will see that the Overall Story Goal and the Overall Story Concern are always one and the same in every storyform . This is because the Concern sits at the Type level of the Dramatica Table of Story Elements , the place where you find the Signposts ( or Acts ) of each Throughline . Type appreciations are the closest thing you will find to " plot " appreciations within Dramatica . <p> Conflict does not exist without context . One man 's problem looks like another man 's solution ; it all depends on how you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual Throughlines to the various Domains , an Author determines the context for conflict within each Throughline . Do n't kid yourself : if you do n't know the context , you do n't have conflict . And if you do n't have conflict , you do n't have a story . <p> You might see this character pop up from time to time in Dramatica . An Archetypal Character made up of equal parts Temptation and Hinder , the Contagonist screws things up for both the bad guys and good guys alike in a story . Dramatica coined this phrase to describe the character of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars as he clearly did n't operate as the Antagonist . <p> You really could swap the definitions for Context with Conflict as they both mean the same thing in the world of story . Conflict does not exist without context . One man 's problem looks like another man 's solution ; it all depends on how you look at it . Setting the context determines why something is even seen as a problem in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turns out the Crucial Element is n't as crucial to the formation of a story as you would think . It simply marks the element that exists at the intersection of the Overall Story Throughline and Main Character Throughline . Crucial to the storyform , but not crucial to implementation of that storyform . In other words , do n't freak out if you do n't get it . <p> This is the general area where you will find a problem for a particular Throughline . Our minds classify problems into four different areas : Situations , Fixed Attitudes , Activities , and Manners of Thinking . By lining up the Four Throughlines with each of these Domains , an Author sets the stage for conflict within their story . <p> The world 's most advanced understanding of narrative--the Dramatica theory of story rests on one simple idea : that a functioning narrative acts as a model of a single human mind trying to solve a problem . Have a story hole or an unmotivated character ? That 's because your story does n't reflect the kind of thinking process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Dramatica and get to know the psychology of your story . <p> The smallest bit of story we can see without losing sight of the bigger picture . The Element level of the Dramatica Table of Story Elements is where you will find the Problem , Solution , Symptom , and Response of a Throughline . These Elements are the closest thing you will find to " character " in Dramatica as they deal with forces directly at play within the individual players of a story . <p> This is by far the smallest amount of resolution one can reach before looping back towards the top of the Dramatica model of story . The model is recursive , which means the bottom looks like the top and here , the Events consist of Situations , Fixed Attitudes , Activities and Manners of Thinking . In a perfectly structured story a Scene consists of four Events--one in each of these Classes . Life is full of chaos , and so should a story if it is to be embraced as expressing the a familiar experience to an Audience . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common : they cover all four Throughlines . That means they have a Main Character Throughline , an Influence Character Throughline , a Relationship Story Throughline between the two of them , and an Overall Story Throughline that covers everyone in the story--even the Main and Influence Characters . Put all four of these in a story and you will be lightyears ahead of anyone else ( Except , of course , those who already have ) . <p> Dramatica 's idea of Genre is not your idea of Genre . No Romantic Comedies . Or Westerns . Or Dramas . Or Science Fiction Action/Adventures . No , Dramatica 's idea of Genre is more about the personality of a narrative , rather than the particulars of the storytelling . The arrangement of Throughlines will create a different kind of story depending on what Domain they fall into . <p> Introduced to the world with the release of Dramatica Story Expert , Gists make life way easier when it comes to working with the theory . Before you might have terms like Conceptualizing or Reduction or Induction to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steal the Money or Keeping One 's Backpack Light or Inferring Something about Someone . Bridging the gap between structure and storytelling , Gists bring Authors closer to their material . <p> The Guardian is an Archetypal Character that represents the drive for Prudence within the Story Mind . One part Conscience and one part Help , this character often acts as a counsel to the Protagonist of a story . <p> Probably the worst concept ever to hit the world of narrative , the idea of the Hero wrecks any meaningful discussion of story . Tied to his equally lame " Hero 's Journey " , this character is supposed to be the most important . But that is an entirely subjective determination . Dramatica 's interpretation of a Hero is simple : the character who represents the personal point-of-view of the Main Character and serves the Protagonist function in the Overall Story . You do n't have to make them both the same character . But when you do , a Hero is born . <p> 5,892 steps for the Hero 's Journey ? Really ? ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near helpful for Authors . It might be interesting from a cultural standpoint , but to suggest that it helps Authors craft meaningful stories is misleading . The Hero 's Journey suggests that every great story is about a Hero who loses his state of perfection , moves to the city to get a sword , and returns home with the elixir . It is a weak attempt to attach story-like symbology to the problem-solving process of the mind that is really at work within a story . The Hero 's Journey , like the cultures it reflects , is a thing of the past . <p> Another nightmare concept of narrative that should go the way of the Dodo , the Inciting Incident is supposed to indicate the start of a story . The tens upon thousands of subjective interpretations of where that start lies require true narratists to ban the concept from their vocabulary . Better to understand Dramatica 's concept of the Story Driver and how that works in concert with the inequity that exists at the center of every story . <p> Anytime we sense a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inequity . Super smart philosophy majors might call this gestalt , but as far as Dramatica is concerned an inequity--or imbalance seen between two things--is the fuel for narrative conflict . Once identified , our minds have to either work to solve that inequity or find an opportunity to balance it away in a process known as Justification . <p> While the Influence Character applies considerable pressure on the Main Character to change his or her approach to solving problems , there is one special quality that undermines this influence . The Influence Character 's Critical Flaw is the kind of thing that , when applied , weakens the impact and makes it easier for the Main Character to avoid their personal problems . <p> In order for a story to work , the Influence Character 's Resolve must be the inverse of the Main Character 's Resolve . If the Main Character 's Resolve is Changed then the Influence Character 's Resolve is Steadfast . If the MC Resolve is Steadfast then the IC Resolve is Changed . You can not write a story where both paradigms shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys in on this dynamic to make sense of the story you told them . <p> Every Main Character sulks around in the shadows of their own psychology . It is only once the Influence Character arrives and starts poking around at their psyche , that the Main Character finally feels enough motivation to grow and develop into something new . These pokes find themselves labeled the Influence Character Signposts within the Dramatica theory of story . They work act-by-act to push or pull the Main Character into moving into their next stage of development . <p> Direct or indirect , the Influence Character 's focus on their Symptom creates a stirring within the Main Character . That stirring is often enough to help motivate the Main Character to re-examine his or her own preconceptions and perhaps grow in their resolve or eventually grow out of their resolve . <p> The Influence Character Throughline is that part of a story that expresses the point-of-view needed to force the Main Character to deal with all their stuff . Separated into four acts ( like every other Throughline ) , the IC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own personal blind spot . <p> This story point represents the Influence Character 's unique ability to force the Main Character to change his or her paradigm . In much the same way that the Main Character Unique Ability reflects the quality that allows him or her to effect a resolution in the Overall Story Throughline , the Influence Character Unique Ability reflects the quality that allows the IC to effect a resolution in the Main Character 's Throughline . The Unique Abilities tie the individual Throughlines to one another ; the IC Unique Ability ties the Influence Character to the Main Character . <p> Closest to Theme in the Dramatica Table of Story Elements , the Issue acts a touchpoint for conflict within a particular Throughline . Situated between the Plot-like Concern appreciation and the Character-like Problem appreciation , the Issue works in tandem with the Counterpoint to offer Author 's commentary on the efforts to resolve the Throughline 's inequity . To be honest though , the Issue is simply another way to say " problem " in Dramatica . <p> Justification is Dramatica 's sophisticated way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside their psyche . Rather than Problem-Solve , a character who justifies buries the inequity deep within the recesses of their mind ... only to have it resurface through the prodding and poking of an Influence Character . <p> The most important part of a complete and effective narrative , the Main Character gives the Audience a way into the story . Leave this perspective out and you will find yourself faced with a cold and lifeless narrative . Embue them with personal baggage that they would take into any story and the Audience will latch onto them . <p> Main Characters have a preference for either trying to solve problems by changing the world around them , or by changing themselves first . If they try to change the world , Dramatica sees them as a Do-er . If they prefer to change themselves first , then we label them a Be-er . Cool fun fact : whatever Approach you choose for the Main Character , the Influence Character will have the opposite one . Boom ! <p> The Main Character Concern can sometimes act as an indicator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . Because we find the Concern on the Type level along with all the other Plot elements , it can sometimes feel like it is a Goal . Really , Concern is just a bigger way of saying Problem . <p> Two parts to a Main Character 's arc : the MC Resolve and the MC Growth . This is the second part , the part that has more to do with the process of arcing from where they are at the beginning of a story to where they are at the end . Main Characters will grow by either dropping an element or gaining a new one . If they drop , they are a Stop character ; if they gain , then they are a Start character . <p> Every character is driven by something . That something is an inequity--a separateness between things--and is inidicated in the narrative by this story point . If the Main Character ends up changing their Resolve and adopting the Influence Character 's paradigm then the Solution to this Problem will be the thing they move towards . If instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolve , then this Problem will actually seem more like source of drive and will be an exceelent way to describe the Main Character . <p> Not enough that we have to determine whether or not the Main Character prefers to solve problems externally or internally through the Main Character Approach , we also have to figure out whether or not the Main Character solves problems linearly like most men , or holistically like most women . Usually this is as simple as selecting the one that most resembles how you yourself solve problems , but you can switch it up to make things more interesting . Setting this does all kinds of things in terms of determining the Act order of different Throughlines . <p> Every Main Character comes to a story with some kind of baggage , some kind of personal problem that gives them grief . Encountering the Influence Character they grow to a point where they have to decide if they were always on the right path and the Influence Character is wrong--or if the IC is right and they need to change their approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then their Resolve is said to be Changed . If instead they maintain their paradigm , then their Resolve is said to be Steadfast . <p> This story point works hand-in-hand with the Main Character Symptom . Whatever the MC thinks their problem is , their Response is what they try and do about it . It is like treating the symptoms of a disease rather than attacking the disease directly--only this disease exists in the mind of the Main Character . <p> This story point demotivates the Main Character by resolving his or her Main Character Problem . Usually only encountered towards the end of a Changed Main Character 's journey , the Solution can show up from time-to-time in a Steadfast Main Character 's journey . When this happens it only temporarily lessens the motivation or drive of the Main Character . Eventually the Problem kicks back in and motivation resumes . <p> All Main Characters have a Problem . This Problem motivates them and drives them to do all kinds of different things that create problems for themselves . But they do n't do anything about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy focusing their attention on the Symptom of the problem instead . It is only towards the end of a narrative that they can finally see the difference between the two . At that point they will make the decision to continue treating the symptoms , or attack the problem directly . <p> The Main Character is that part of a story that reveals an intimate personal look at problem-solving . Covering the personal baggage that exists within the Main Character and the Main Character alone , this Throughline gives an Audience the opportunity to experience act-by-act , the process by which one goes about resolving their personal differences . <p> This story point reflects that unique quality of character that makes it possible for the Main Character to resolve any of the issues within the Overall Story Throughline . Whether an intergral part or attributed to , this Unique Ability ties the Main Charater into the Overall Story and answers the question why he or she needs to be in the story at all . <p> This is what the Main Character Problem-Solving Style used to be called back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linear , a Female setting indicated Holistic . The story point still functions the same--it sets the order of Signposts and other niceties--but it comes in a more easily digestable package now . <p> This is a fancy way of saying how characters do the things they do . One of the four parts of a full developed character ( along with Motivations , Evaluations , and Purposes ) , the Methodology elements of the Overall Story Characters cover things like Proaction , Reaction , Acceptance and Non-Acceptance . <p> Why , oh why wo n't this go away ? Once you understand Dramatica and its concept of the Story Mind , you see the Monomyth and its cousin The Hero 's Journey as a failed attempt to codify the problem-solving process of the human mind . They attach words like Swords and Elixirs and Gateway Guardians because that is what they have seen repeated time and time again in stories . Understanding why they keep reappearing in different cultures requires looking to psychology and Dramatica . <p> The easiest and first thing anyone learns when they first arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what drives them to do the things they do . Motivations like Pursuit and Avoid and Conscience and Temptation tell an Audience what they can expect from that character . The Motivations work in concert with three other aspects of character--Methodologies , Evaluations , and Purposes to help round out the characters in a story . <p> Who wants to write an objective character ? Characters are fun and lively and emotive and interesting--why stifle them with objectivity ? The answer is : characters function as parts of a larger whole , as a part of the Story Mind . Sure , you have Subjective Characters in the Main and Influence Character , but the objective Overall Story Throughline demands objecctive characters . Here , characters are seen less as people , and more as functions within the narrative . <p> Once the Overall Story Problem kicks in and the story begins , the characters in the story will start to become concerned with the Overall Story Concern . Every Throughline exists to offer an opportunity for an Audience to see the Problem of that Throughline in varying degrees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the story 's Problem and the conflict that arises from it . This Concern will receive so much attention that the Overall Story Goal will be of the same Type as the Overall Story Concern . <p> The Overall Story Throughline explores the efforts to resolve the story 's problem at varying degrees of magnification . At the Theme level of the Dramatica Table of Story Elements , the Problem appears as a thematic Issue that measures the relative value of the efforts to resolve that very same Problem . Every Issue comes complete with a matching Counterpoint in order to measure both sides of the argument . <p> This is it . The whole reason why all the characters in a story come into conflict with another . The Overall Story Problem begins with the initial Story Driver and continues until someone resolves it with the Overall Story Solution . Discover this Problem and your story will never falter for a lack of drive . Overall Story points are boring to describe because they 're objective and devoid of emotion . That 's a good thing--no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Overall Story Solution in an effort to resolve the problems created by the Overall Story Problem . Once in place , the story can end with a Story Outcome of Success . Fail to reach it , and the story ends with a Story Outcome of Failure . Overall Story points are lifeless and logical--as they should be . They showcase the objective elements of a narrative . Feeling has no place in objectivity . <p> When you step outside of a story and look at all the characters as " Them " , you are looking at the Overall Story Throughline . From here the characters look more like functions rather than actual people . Protagonist . Antagonist . Guardian and Skeptic . Their roles within the story take center stage from this perspective . When you think of a story , you 're thinking of the Overall Story Throughline . <p> The good guys lose and the Main Character goes home happy . That is the basic definition of a Personal Tragedy story . Mix a Story Outcome of Failure with a Story Judgment of Good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeter side of things . <p> You know that feeling when you finally succeed at something , but you still feel miserable about yourself ? That 's a Personal Triumph story . The good guys win , but the Main Character goes home sad and angst-ridden . Mix a Story Outcome of Success with a Story Judgment of Bad and you get this bittersweet ending that falls more towards the bitter side of things . <p> Is there a difference between Plot-oriented stories and Character-driven stories ? No , that 's a silly idea . Both Plot and Character work together in unison to help support and develop the story 's central argument . Plot Dynamics like the Story Driver , the Story Limit , the Story Outcome , and the Story Judgment help set the stage for the events to come . <p> A Plot Point in Dramatica is essentially one of the Story Drivers that helps turn the story from one Act to the next . You need one to start the story and one to end the story . One to break it up in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story down into four movements , four Acts . You can have more , but you need to have at least these five to define the edges of the story for your Audience . <p> How does a Throughline develop from one Act to the next ? By progression through the four Signposts that define the context of the conflict of that Throughline . Once a story explores all four Signposts , the Audience will know the location of the story problem and how best to solve it . <p> Dramatica features a crazy advanced report that actually shows an Author what the structure of the story looks like to the characters . That is insane . It is one thing to present an objective view of story dynamics and how they all work together , but then to also show what the narrative looks like subjectively is almost too much to handle . Stay away from this report unless you want to cheat . <p> The dramatic circuit of narrative consists of four components : Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome ( or Power ) . Outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' P ' in the anachronym . While not a strict translation of an electric circuit , the analogy exists as a means of communicating the spatial relationship between these components . Combine them together and you create a unit of narrative . <p> Each Throughline exists to provide an Audience an alternative way of looking at the story 's central problem . While this problem can be seen at varying degrees of magnification , the absolute smallest finest resolution at which we can determine this problem is the Problem of that Throughline . Every Problem features its own Solution and a key towards the efforts of the characters in that story to resolve that problem . <p> Problem-Solving is what we do when we are n't involved in Justification--that is , when we 're trying to actually resolve the differences in our lives , rather than trying to hide from them . Interesting fun fact : a linear-thinker 's approach to problem-solving is seen as justification from a holistic-thinker 's point-of-view and vice versa . If that does n't make sense , substitute " man " for linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we can so easily see into each other 's blind spots . <p> When Dramatica first came out , Problem-Solving Style was called Mental Sex--the idea being that men and women solved problems differently . Males approach problems from a Linear point-of-view , while females approach things from a Holistic perspective . Since then , the theory adjusted the Story Point to the less controversial Problem-Solving Style while maintaining the core concept of the idea . Setting this Story Point dictates the order of Signposts within a Throughline . <p> No , this is n't who the story is about . It 's also not the person we care the most about . And it certainly is n't interchangeable with Main Character or Hero . In Dramatica the Protagonist is very clearly defined : that objective character that both Pursues and Considers the Story Goal . Now , sometimes this character can also be the Main Character ( in which case he or she is considered a Hero ) , but it does n't always have to be that way . <p> Everything in Dramatica is based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will begin to notice that everything is broken down into 4s . Four Throughlines , four Signposts , four Character Dynamics , four Plot Dynamics , four Domains , and so on and so fourth ( ! ) . This is because this is how our minds differentiate the external and internal worlds . Know the quad and you will know Dramatica . <p> Elsewhere you will read that this Story Point represents the philosophical argument between Main and Influence Character . Wrong . The Relationship Story Issue of a story is less concerned with an argument between the Main Character and Influence Character and more concerned with the issue that exists in the relationship between these two . If their Issue is Commitment , it does n't mean they will be arguing about Commitment ; it means their relationship will have Commitment issues . <p> Less the source of a problem between them and more a motivator towards engaging in the relationship , the Relationship Story Problem brings Main and Influence Character together . Whether or growing or dissolving relationship , this Problem continues to motivate interaction until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story Solution . <p> The heart of every story . Without this Throughline , a story feels emotionless and concerned more with satisfaction than any real fulfillment . Covering the relationship between the Main Character and the Influence Character , the Relationship Story Throughline is where true emotion happens and where we as an Audience can visit the conflict and attempts to resolve that conflict that exist in the space between us . Once erroneously referred to as the " Main vs . Impact " Throughline , this part of the story is all about the conflict that arises in our relationships with others . <p> In every Throughline there is a Problem that motivates everything . However , the Problem is obscured because the attention is focused on the Symptom of that Problem , not the Problem itself . In an effort to alleviate perceived conflict arising from the Symptom , the Response is taken . <p> These are the smallest chunks of narrative people usually think of when writing a story . Technically , a smaller resolution exists--the Events within a scene--but for most writers , the Scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scenes exist within a Sequence . But the world is not perfect , and neither should a story . Understanding the purpose behind a Scene within the greater argument makes it easier to decide which Scenes to leave in , and which ones to blend into others . <p> Structure is structure regardless of medium , and regardless of size . A short story functions the same way as a " tall " story , only there is n't enough time to explore everything . Take any quad in the Dramatica Table of Story Elements and you have yourself a story . Audiences want to see the entirety of a quad explored . <p> Four Signposts per Throughline , four Acts per storyline . Acts , or Signposts as Dramatica calls them , exist to offer an Audience that chance to see how conflict could possible be resolved within different contexts . Each Throughline breaks down into four different ways to resolve the problems in that storyline . Once all four ways have been explored , the story is over , and the Audience can determine what it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group , the Skeptic represents both the motivation to Oppose everything and to proclaim Disbelief towards any action taken towards the contrary . An Archetypal Character found often in films that play down the importance of characters , the Skeptic is always there to chime in with " Game over , man ! " <p> In every Throughline there exists a Problem . The Solution resolves that problem and restores equity . Unfortunately , there is a certain amount of unawareness to the ' Problem ' in each Throughline as well . Instead , attention focuses on the Symptom of that Problem , and the Response taken to alleviate those symptoms . Eventually both Problem and Symptom are seen for what they really are and a choice is made to continue engaging in the Response or try something new with the Solution . Regardless of the choice made , only the Solution resolves the Problem . <p> SRCA stands for Setup , Revelation , Conflict , and Aftermath . The numbers 1234 can be substituted for SRCA as they both reflect the order in which a dramatic circuit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Storyweaving time-shifting technique found in films like Memento or Pulp Fiction . The order is determined by the storyform and carries with it a unique signature that helps define the story 's dynamics . <p> When you hear that a character " arcs " , the growth of that character 's development is either away from something , or towards something . Believe it or not , those are two very different ways of telling a story . If the character is growing towards something , then their Main Character Growth is Start . <p> In any awesome story , one of the principal characters will stand their ground and stay true to their belief system while the other principal will do a complete 180 . If the Main Character stands their ground , the Influence Character will flip their perspective . If the Influence Character stands their ground , then the Main Character flips--or has their perspective Changed by the Influence Character . This concept explores the latter situation wherein the Main Charcter adopts the Influence Character 's point-of-view . <p> In any awesome story , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their belief system while the other principal will do a complete 180 . If the Main Character stands their ground , the Influence Character will flip their perspective . If the Influence Character stands their ground , then the Main Character flips--or has their perspective Changed by the Influence Character . This concept explores the former situation wherein the Influence Character adopts the Main Character 's point-of-view . <p> You can not have a Story Goal without a Story Consequence ; one does not exist without the other . Sometimes referred to as the " stakes " of a story , the Consequence motivates the drive towards a successful resolution in the Overall Story Throughline If you are looking to increase the conflict in your story , the Story Consequence is the first place to look . <p> What starts , stops , and moves a story forward--this is the realm of the Story Driver . Do Actions drive Decisions or do Decisions drive Actions ? The answer is yes . And like the conundrum of the chicken and the egg and which one comes first , an author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cool pro tip : all your major plot point will be of the same type--either all Actions or all Decisions . <p> This is the Goal everyone is focused on . Some are for it . Some are for against it . Once the initial Story Driver creates the story 's central inequity and Overall Story Problem , the Overall Story Solution becomes apparent . The Story Goal is an attempt to reach that Solution . <p> The Audience wants to know the emotional state of the Main Character at the end of the story . Were the events of the narrative worth it , or are they still troubled and angst-ridden about their personal baggage ? Theoretically speaking this story point reflects the emotional state of the narrative as a whole--meaning , does the Author feel like the efforts to solve the problem were a Good thing or a Bad thing ? <p> You know those films , novels , and plays that seem to go on and on and on with no end in sight ? That 's because they do n't have in place a strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited by Options or Time in the very first Act , remind us in the subsequent Acts , and have the final Option or Second tick away in the last Act . That is how the Audience will know a story is over . Oh . Break the Story Limit by changing it or disrespecting it and the Audience will not forgive you . <p> The nature of a story is either a Work or a Dilemma . On top of this you apply either Actual or Apparent to create a quad of options for this Story Point . Either the characters were right to participate in the Work or the Dilemma , or they were wrong and it only seemed like a Work or a Dilemma . The latter is Apparent , the former Actual . This Story Point is a part of Dramatica 's four Audience Appreciations and is a combination of the Main Character Resolve and the Story Outcome . <p> Usually this is as simple as asking , Do the good guys win or lose ? But sometimes you can run into narratives where the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which case a Success Outcome would feature the bad guys winning . Confusing ? Here 's an easier way . Did the efforts to reach the Story Goal end in Success or Failure ? Answer that and you will know the Story Outcome . <p> Both Author and Audience share a common ground--a thin veil of communication wherein they can see through to each other 's respective point-of-view . These points of commonality are referred to as Story Points and can be found delineated within Dramatica 's concept of the storyform . The clearer your Story Points the more your message will get through to the other side . <p> This is the second stage of the process whereby an Author tries to communicate something of import to an Audience . The first stage is Storyforming where the Author chooses individual Story Points to carry the message out into the world . In this second stage , the Author crafts the Story Points into points unique and personal to his or her own message . In this way , no two stories can be the same even if they maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a collection of 75 story points that form a holistic image of a story 's intended meaning . What does that mean in plain English ? The storyform is a bunch of story points that make up the structure of your story . We say holistic because they all work together--they 're not independent . The current version of Dramatica sees at least 32,767 unique storyforms . There are more , but they require further development and it 's hard enough teaching everyone the current model . <p> Storyforming ? Is that anything like terraforming ? I guess so--if building a story was like building a planet . The Storyforming stage is where an author begins to predict how their story will turn out and what kind of effect it might have on their intended audience . In short , it 's where the Author structures their story . There are three more subsequent phases--Storytelling , Storyweaving , and Story Reception . <p> The Storymind concept rests at the heart of everything that is Dramatica . In short , Dramatica sees every story as a model of a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this model results in story holes or inconsistent and schizophrenic stories . This is one of the givens for the Dramatica theory--if you ca n't buy into this concept then everything that follows is not worth your time . <p> Less about how to tell a story and more about how a story is told , Storytelling in Dramatica is everything that is unique and special to the Author 's creative muse . It is where an Author brings life to lifeless terms like Prerequisites and Preconditions and where the story takes on a life of its own . <p> Every Throughline finds its conflict motivated by a Problem . The only reason this Problem continues to wreck havoc is because the attention of those in the Throughline is focused on the Symptoms of the problem , not the Problem itself . In essence , the Throughline is blind to the Problem because of this focus on the Symptom . <p> Nothing wrong with a tale . Especially if you do n't care about Audience members remembering your tale 48 hours later or you do n't mind them not recommending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , but are soon forgotten as they do n't add up to anything more than what they are . A Complete Story offers so much more than a Tale , and Audiences nowadays are wise to them . <p> Want to know something cool about Theme ? Get this , if a great story is really just an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem , then Theme is really just the evaluations of that single human mind at work . Awesome , right ? Theme is no longer this big imposing intimidating thing--just another aspect of the mind along with Character , Plot , and Genre . <p> Thought , Knowledge , Ability , and Desire function as the base for everything in Dramatica . And when we say everything , we mean everything . From top to bottom , left to right , and everywhere in-between take a quad of four items within the Dramatica Table of Story Elements and you will find equivalents to Thought , Knowledge , Ability , and Desire . Think of these as the building blocks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make everyone in the Audience miserable ? Write a Tragedy . The good guys lose and the Main Characters goes home sad ( assuming he or she actually survives ) .

Worked for Shakespeare more than once ; might work for you . <p> Everyone loves a happy ending , right ? Put a Story Outcome of Success alongside the equally chipper Story Judgment of Good and you have yourself the makings of a Hollywood blockbuster . Of course , if everyone is making Triumphs who is serving the remaining 75% of storytelling ? <p> Ugh . Who really wastes their time thinking of who the Villain is in there story ? Better to leave that kind of subjective interpretation to the Audience and concentrate on writing a great story . Dramatica 's interpretation of a Villain is simple : the character who represents the alternative point-of-view to the Main Character ( the Influence Character ) and serves the Antagonist function in the Overall Story Throughline .

If they were , there would be no need to put them in a " story " . A story is a construct , a functioning living entity designed to grant the viewer/reader a greater understanding of how things work ( meaningful problem-solving ) .

Better to leave that kind of subjective interpretation to the Audience and concentrate on writing a great story . Dramatica 's interpretation of a Villain is simple : the character who represents the alternative point-of-view to the Main Character ( the Influence Character ) and serves the Antagonist function in the Overall Story Throughline . You do n't have to make them both the same character . But when you do , you have a Villain .

More than a random reality at the mercy of the Authors Muse , the feeling of dramatic tension within a narrative is traceable and discernible . The direction of development within the Main Character and the overall emotional state of the story itself gives writers a clue as to the nature of that tension . <h> Always Four <p> The Dramatica theory of story always works in fours . The entire model is based on the quad " the result of the way our minds organize and process information . We see Mass , Energy , Space , and Time because we think Knowledge , Thought , Ability , and Desire . In fact , the latter four correlate with the first four : Knowledge is the Mass of the Mind just as Thought is the Energy of the Mind . <p> Ability and Desire are the Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to explain , and not something we are going to cover in this weeks article . <p> Last week we began a discussion on Dramaticas Audience Apprecations . As mentioned , most of Dramatica focuses on observable objective story points seen from the point-of-view of the Author . The Audience Appreciations offer the Author an opportunity to predict how an Audience will perceive their story based on the makeup of their narrative . <h> Passing Judgment on the Main Characters Approach <p> The Essence of a story is described as the primary dramatic feel of a story : <p> A story can be appreciated as the interaction of dynamics that converge at the climax . From this point of view , the feel of the dramatic tension can be defined . Dramatic tension is created between the direction the Main Character is growing compared to the authors value judgment of that growth . <p> Dramatica predicts how the Audience will feel by defining the dramatic tension between two story points : the Main Character Growth and the Story Judgment . Balancing these two touch-points of narrative against each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dynamics of their story . It defines what their story means to the Audience . <h> The Main Character Growth <p> Main Characters " arc " by either growing into something or by growing out of something . While it may seem like six of one , half a dozen of the other , the Main Character Growth defines the direction of personal development for the central character . By setting the location of the story worlds larger problem in opposition to the Main Characters personal problems , the story identifies a path of growth for working through the unravelling of the justification process . <p> If the Main Character grows into something , then their Growth reflects a Start direction . If the Main Character grows out of something , then their Growth showcases a Stop direction . <p> Look to Kirk ( Chris Pine ) in 2009s Star Trek or Sidney Prescott ( Neve Campbell ) in ScreamKirk grows into his leadership role by holding out for the naysayers and the villains to Stop coming down on him . Likewise with Sidneythough slightly tweakedshe grows by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On the flip side , check out Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon ) in Bournes first flick The Bourne Identity or Gerd Wiesler ( Ulrich Muhe ) in the magnificent film The Lives of Others . Jason grows into his new life by holding out for those set against him to Start revealing who they really are . Wiesler grows by gaining a sense of compassion for those he spies on . <p> The direction of growth the Main Character develops is only half of the equation when it comes to determining the feeling of tension in a story . <h> The Story Judgment <p> The Author also passes judgment on the storys efforts to resolve the central problem by declaring the process a Good thing or a Bad thing within the Story Judgment . Typically , this result shows up in the maintanence or reduction of the Main Characters personal angst . If the Main Character works through their issues , that is seen as Good thing . If instead their angst persists or even grows larger , than that is seen as a Bad thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brokeback Mountain or Mr. McAlister ( Matthew Broderick ) in Electionthey end their narratives saddled with the weight of their own personal angst . Contrast this with Ted Kramer ( Dustin Hoffman ) in Kramer vs . Kramer or Joy ( Amy Poehler ) in Inside Outthey complete their stories relieved of stress and anxiety . <p> The Story Judgment can also be seen as the relative emotional appraisal of the storys characters at the end of the narrative . Were the efforts to resolve the inequity at large seen as mostly Good , or mostly Bad ? Regardless of scope , the key is communicating the Authors intent to the Audiencehow should they interpret the emotional judgment of the storys efforts to resolve conflict ? <h> The Essence of Dramatic Tension <p> The problem with the story point of Essence is the semantic values Chris and Melanie chose to define it : Positive Feel or Negative Feel . Start/Good and Stop/Bad stories specify a story with a Positive Feel ; Stop/Good and Start/Bad characterize stories with a Negative Feel . <p> I 'm not so sure Romeo and Juliet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamlet would be categorized as a positive story . That 's insane . <p> When I first discovered Dramatica twenty years ago , this seemed like the craziest story point . It did n't  feel right and at the time , I chalked it up to an area of the theory that was inaccurate . Every story paradigm I had encountered up to that moment had some caveat , something that was n't quite right . My guess was that Essence fell into the same category.1 <p> The definition of Positive Feel did n't  help either : <p> When a Main Characters approach is deemed proper , the audience hopes for him to remain steadfast in that approach and to succeed . Regardless of whether he actually succeeds or fails , if he remains steadfast he wins a moral victory and the audience feels the story is positive . When the approach is deemed improper , the audience hopes for him to change . Whether or not the Main Character succeeds , if he changes from an improper approach to a proper one he also win a moral victory and the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of Main Character Resolve and Story Judgment , not Main Character Growth . <p> What exactly were Chris and Melanie hinting at ? You cant really mistake a story with a Positive Feel when compared to a Negative Feel . Even the definition for Negative Feel mentions " uppers " and " downers . " Reading that , one would even go so far as to assume that there would be far more " uppers " than " downers " . <h> A Surprise Discovery <p> This is , of course , what I intended to find when I started writing this article . Thinking I would gain the same insightful results I did from last weeks article , I figured data existed confirming the notion that Positive Feeling stories far outweighed the Negative Feels . Having spent the entire day crafting a beautifully worded 2,500+ word article , I assumed I would emerge with yet another amazing article proving Dramaticas ability to predict emotion <p> turns out I was dead wrong . The two types of stories split 50/50 pretty much down the middle . 160 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No real insight . Nothing really interesting to add to the conversation . <p> A thought occurredcould it be that Chris and Melanie made a mistake in naming the semantic values for Essence ? <h> Misleading Terminology <p> The definition for Essence only adds to the confusion : <p> When a Main Character Stops doing something Bad , that is positive . When a Main Character Starts doing something Good , that also is positive . However , when a Main Character Starts doing something Bad or Stops doing something Good , these are negative <p> So Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamill ) is stopping something good and that feels negative . But Leonard Shelby ( Guy Pearce ) from Memento is stopping something bad and that is somehow positive . <p> Ok <p> Turns out the answer was buried within the definition of Essence and made even clearer in the QnA article on Is Negative Feeling merely descriptive or is it instrumental ? : <p> A positive story is one where the characters are doggedly pursuing a solution to their troublesthey seem to be in control . A negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters as they attempt to escape its effectsthey seem to be at the mercy of the problem . <p> Ohhhhhh , now that makes sense . <p> Yes Leonard feels like he is doggedly pursuing a solution and yes , Star Wars feels as if the problems dog the characters as they attempt to escape its effects . That totally feels right . <p> If Essence really is about the feeling of dramatic tension in the story then that tension does n't  feel positive or negative <p> It feels Overwhelming or Surmountable . <h> Beset By Overwhelming Odds <p> Growth describes the transitory state of the Main Characters development throughout the story . Remember that the storyform has time built into it . Though it may look like a single set of story points defining the state of things , it simultaneously delineates the passage of time through the mental processes of a single human mind solving a problem . <p> The essence of that transition can be seen in the juxtaposition of the Main Character Growth and the Story Judgment . That feeling of Good does n't  simply exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirety of the storymind itself " right along with the Growth . It explains the emotional state of the mind processing through this particular instance of problem-solving . <p> And that emotional state can be described as either Overwhelming or Surmountable . <p> Take for instance the feeling of Overwhelming in stories marked by a Growth of Stop and Judgment of Good : <p> Eastern Promises , Looper , and Rocky ? You do n't  get more overwhelming then a story about dealing with the Russian mob , a story about assassins from the future returning to the present to kill you , and a story about fighting in a boxing match you have no chance of winning . <p> And Joe and Ratso do n't  exactly find New York a hospitable place in Midnight Cowboy either . <p> What about a Growth of Start and a Judgment of Bad : <p> You probably have n't seen Eves Bayou , but let me tell you " things do n't  get more overwhelming than growing up in a Creole-American fractured family in Louisiana . <p> These films and 126 more offer Audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems that overwhelm the senses and cloud proper judgment . <h> Surmountable Obstacles <p> On the other side , we have those stories that present a set of surmountable obstacles . Instead of overwhelmed by the weight of their issues , the characters in these stories assume control and pursue solutions because the conflict appears disputable and tenuous . <p> A sample of Start/Good stories : <p> Being John Malkovich , As Good As It Gets , and City Slickers " these are not films that overwhelm their characters with insurmountable odds . Instead , they put the characters in the drivers seat . While living inside Malkovichs head , recovering from a hate crime , and herding cattle can be difficult at times " its not something either of them cant handle.3 <p> Witness a continuation of this trend with a sample of Stop/Bad stories : <p> Grave of the Fireflies " if you have n't seen it , is one of the saddest movies you will ever see .

Mortensen might have felt overwhelmed in Eastern Promises , but in History his character Tom Stall has everything under control.5 <h> A Moment of Clarity <p> There exists a science to narrative . While many feel overwhelmed by the prospect of learning the various touch-points and mental forces behind story , the task remains a surmountable one . Either struggle with dropping preconceptions and misunderstandings and retain your personal angst ( Stop/Bad ) , or grow into a new understanding by adding a better appreciation of story and watch your angst and anxiety slowly dissipate and fade away ( Start/Good ) . <p> We prefer the latter . <p> Whether your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater understanding of the kind of dramatic tension in a story promises a lifetime of carefree and unfettered expression .

A lack of resolution , but a positive growth nonetheless . <h> Look to Inequity <p> When is a problem not a problem ? When it acts more as a source of drive rather than a messenger of difficulties . The Problems located at the base of each Throughline indicate the nature of the inequity as seen from that perspective . Understanding this allows Authors the freedom to develop solidly structured stories without feeling hampered by unnecessary constraints . 
@@119273219 @8273219/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Concepts <p> These are those huge chunks of narrative Aristotle uncovered way back when . Though he said there were only three--beginning , middle , and end--when in reality the structure of the story dictates the number of Acts in a work . Two Acts . Three Acts . Four Acts . It all depends on other dynamic factors and could be different across different Throughlines . Thankfully , Dramatica figures it all out for us so we can concentrate on writing the story our heart tells us to write . <p> This is the character who works to Prevent the Protagonist from winning . Couple this motivation with a penchant for getting people to Reconsider and you have the workings of a classic Antagonist . Give them the Influence Character role and suddenly you have the makings of a classic Villain ( think the Joker in The Dark Knight ) . And no , James Bond is NOT the Antagonist no matter what someone tells you , it just does n't play out . <p> Everyone thinks Archetypes represent some sort of aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Doorstop , and the Gateway Guardian . They do n't . Archetypes function as analagoies to forces and drives within our own minds . The Protagonist represents our tendency towards Initiating action . The Antagonist represents Reticence within the mind . Once you see characters as parts of a Story Mind these other names seem silly and made-up . <p> " Everything before the Forestory--or what most people just call the story . This is where Justifications are built and Problems begin . If you want to know why a character is motivated to do what they do , you 'll find the answer in here . There is nothing wrong with Backstory--in fact , you kinda need it . But you need a sophisticated way to present it without someone standing there explaining it all . <p> In any awesome story , one of the principal characters will do a complete 180 on what they believe while the other principal will stand their ground . If the Main Character flips their perspective , the Influence Character will remain steadfast . If the Influence Character flips--or has their perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This concept explores the latter situation wherein the Influence Character adopts the Main Character 's point-of-view . <p> In any awesome story , one of the principal characters will do a complete 180 on what they believe while the other principal will stand their ground . If the Main Character flips their perspective , the Influence Character will remain steadfast . If the Influence Character flips--or has their perspective Changed , then the Main Character will remain steadfast . This concept explores the former situation wherein the Main Character adopts the Influence Character 's point-of-view . <p> In Dramatica , Character can be found at the Element level . This is where you will find the Motivations , Methodolgies , Evaluations , and Purposes of the Story Mind . Some characters act as objectified versions of forces and influences while others act as subjective points-of-view held within the mind . Once you stop seeing them as " real " people and start seeing them as individual parts of one whole , you will start to understand how to write better characters . <p> This is how a character changes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is part of it , but Dramatica looks deeper into that change and explains in detail all the components that make up that " change " . First you have your Resolve which tells whether or not they grow into their point-of-view or grow out of their point-of-view . And then you have their Growth which explains if they grow by dropping an unwanted characteristic or by grabbing a new one . Combine the two together and you have what most people commonly refer to as Character Arc . <p> You know the characters in your story , but do you know what they are actually made up of ? Who is driven by Faith . By Temptation . By Support or Pursuit or Avoid or driven to Hinder ? Who is Proactive ? Reactive ? Inactive ? Who Trusts ? Tests ? Tries to Prove their point or Expects the worst from others ? Who seeks out how things Actually are and who would rather examine their own Perceptions or look for greater Knowledge or Chaos ? Do you have any characters who share the same elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise they will come across as redundant and ineffective . <p> You have likely heard of the Inciting Incident of a story , but have you ever considered the Closing Event ? Dramatica really does n't even refer to the beginning and end of a story in this sort of subjective viewpoint . Instead it looks to the Story Drivers to see what forces begin the inequity of a story , and what bring them to some kind of resolution . You need to know both ends of your story in order for it all to make sense . <p> Want to write a story that everyone will love ? Want to make sure you do n't have any story holes ? Then you are going to have to learn how to write a complete story . In Dramatica this is easily done by making sure you cover all the Four Throughlines needed to make a complete argument . Main Character , Influence Character , Relationship Story , and Overall Story . Cover all those bases and you will have a complete and fulfilling story . <p> Everyone wants a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not necessarily . Some would rather spend their time on settings and entertaining action sequences and for them , we have Archetypal Characters . But for everyone else we have Complex Characters . Take what is the expected set of character elements that work together for a certain aspect within the Story Mind and mix them up . That 's a Complex Character . <p> The Concern of a Throughline can often be seen as the Goal of that Throughline . In fact , if you look closely enough you will see that the Overall Story Goal and the Overall Story Concern are always one and the same in every storyform . This is because the Concern sits at the Type level of the Dramatica Table of Story Elements , the place where you find the Signposts ( or Acts ) of each Throughline . Type appreciations are the closest thing you will find to " plot " appreciations within Dramatica . <p> Conflict does not exist without context . One man 's problem looks like another man 's solution ; it all depends on how you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual Throughlines to the various Domains , an Author determines the context for conflict within each Throughline . Do n't kid yourself : if you do n't know the context , you do n't have conflict . And if you do n't have conflict , you do n't have a story . <p> You might see this character pop up from time to time in Dramatica . An Archetypal Character made up of equal parts Temptation and Hinder , the Contagonist screws things up for both the bad guys and good guys alike in a story . Dramatica coined this phrase to describe the character of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars as he clearly did n't operate as the Antagonist . <p> You really could swap the definitions for Context with Conflict as they both mean the same thing in the world of story . Conflict does not exist without context . One man 's problem looks like another man 's solution ; it all depends on how you look at it . Setting the context determines why something is even seen as a problem in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turns out the Crucial Element is n't as crucial to the formation of a story as you would think . It simply marks the element that exists at the intersection of the Overall Story Throughline and Main Character Throughline . Crucial to the storyform , but not crucial to implementation of that storyform . In other words , do n't freak out if you do n't get it . <p> This is the general area where you will find a problem for a particular Throughline . Our minds classify problems into four different areas : Situations , Fixed Attitudes , Activities , and Manners of Thinking . By lining up the Four Throughlines with each of these Domains , an Author sets the stage for conflict within their story . <p> The world 's most advanced understanding of narrative--the Dramatica theory of story rests on one simple idea : that a functioning narrative acts as a model of a single human mind trying to solve a problem . Have a story hole or an unmotivated character ? That 's because your story does n't reflect the kind of thinking process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Dramatica and get to know the psychology of your story . <p> The smallest bit of story we can see without losing sight of the bigger picture . The Element level of the Dramatica Table of Story Elements is where you will find the Problem , Solution , Symptom , and Response of a Throughline . These Elements are the closest thing you will find to " character " in Dramatica as they deal with forces directly at play within the individual players of a story . <p> This is by far the smallest amount of resolution one can reach before looping back towards the top of the Dramatica model of story . The model is recursive , which means the bottom looks like the top and here , the Events consist of Situations , Fixed Attitudes , Activities and Manners of Thinking . In a perfectly structured story a Scene consists of four Events--one in each of these Classes . Life is full of chaos , and so should a story if it is to be embraced as expressing the a familiar experience to an Audience . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common : they cover all four Throughlines . That means they have a Main Character Throughline , an Influence Character Throughline , a Relationship Story Throughline between the two of them , and an Overall Story Throughline that covers everyone in the story--even the Main and Influence Characters . Put all four of these in a story and you will be lightyears ahead of anyone else ( Except , of course , those who already have ) . <p> Dramatica 's idea of Genre is not your idea of Genre . No Romantic Comedies . Or Westerns . Or Dramas . Or Science Fiction Action/Adventures . No , Dramatica 's idea of Genre is more about the personality of a narrative , rather than the particulars of the storytelling . The arrangement of Throughlines will create a different kind of story depending on what Domain they fall into . <p> Introduced to the world with the release of Dramatica Story Expert , Gists make life way easier when it comes to working with the theory . Before you might have terms like Conceptualizing or Reduction or Induction to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steal the Money or Keeping One 's Backpack Light or Inferring Something about Someone . Bridging the gap between structure and storytelling , Gists bring Authors closer to their material . <p> The Guardian is an Archetypal Character that represents the drive for Prudence within the Story Mind . One part Conscience and one part Help , this character often acts as a counsel to the Protagonist of a story . <p> Probably the worst concept ever to hit the world of narrative , the idea of the Hero wrecks any meaningful discussion of story . Tied to his equally lame " Hero 's Journey " , this character is supposed to be the most important . But that is an entirely subjective determination . Dramatica 's interpretation of a Hero is simple : the character who represents the personal point-of-view of the Main Character and serves the Protagonist function in the Overall Story . You do n't have to make them both the same character . But when you do , a Hero is born . <p> 5,892 steps for the Hero 's Journey ? Really ? ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near helpful for Authors . It might be interesting from a cultural standpoint , but to suggest that it helps Authors craft meaningful stories is misleading . The Hero 's Journey suggests that every great story is about a Hero who loses his state of perfection , moves to the city to get a sword , and returns home with the elixir . It is a weak attempt to attach story-like symbology to the problem-solving process of the mind that is really at work within a story . The Hero 's Journey , like the cultures it reflects , is a thing of the past . <p> Another nightmare concept of narrative that should go the way of the Dodo , the Inciting Incident is supposed to indicate the start of a story . The tens upon thousands of subjective interpretations of where that start lies require true narratists to ban the concept from their vocabulary . Better to understand Dramatica 's concept of the Story Driver and how that works in concert with the inequity that exists at the center of every story . <p> Anytime we sense a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inequity . Super smart philosophy majors might call this gestalt , but as far as Dramatica is concerned an inequity--or imbalance seen between two things--is the fuel for narrative conflict . Once identified , our minds have to either work to solve that inequity or find an opportunity to balance it away in a process known as Justification . <p> While the Influence Character applies considerable pressure on the Main Character to change his or her approach to solving problems , there is one special quality that undermines this influence . The Influence Character 's Critical Flaw is the kind of thing that , when applied , weakens the impact and makes it easier for the Main Character to avoid their personal problems . <p> In order for a story to work , the Influence Character 's Resolve must be the inverse of the Main Character 's Resolve . If the Main Character 's Resolve is Changed then the Influence Character 's Resolve is Steadfast . If the MC Resolve is Steadfast then the IC Resolve is Changed . You can not write a story where both paradigms shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys in on this dynamic to make sense of the story you told them . <p> Every Main Character sulks around in the shadows of their own psychology . It is only once the Influence Character arrives and starts poking around at their psyche , that the Main Character finally feels enough motivation to grow and develop into something new . These pokes find themselves labeled the Influence Character Signposts within the Dramatica theory of story . They work act-by-act to push or pull the Main Character into moving into their next stage of development . <p> Direct or indirect , the Influence Character 's focus on their Symptom creates a stirring within the Main Character . That stirring is often enough to help motivate the Main Character to re-examine his or her own preconceptions and perhaps grow in their resolve or eventually grow out of their resolve . <p> The Influence Character Throughline is that part of a story that expresses the point-of-view needed to force the Main Character to deal with all their stuff . Separated into four acts ( like every other Throughline ) , the IC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own personal blind spot . <p> This story point represents the Influence Character 's unique ability to force the Main Character to change his or her paradigm . In much the same way that the Main Character Unique Ability reflects the quality that allows him or her to effect a resolution in the Overall Story Throughline , the Influence Character Unique Ability reflects the quality that allows the IC to effect a resolution in the Main Character 's Throughline . The Unique Abilities tie the individual Throughlines to one another ; the IC Unique Ability ties the Influence Character to the Main Character . <p> Closest to Theme in the Dramatica Table of Story Elements , the Issue acts a touchpoint for conflict within a particular Throughline . Situated between the Plot-like Concern appreciation and the Character-like Problem appreciation , the Issue works in tandem with the Counterpoint to offer Author 's commentary on the efforts to resolve the Throughline 's inequity . To be honest though , the Issue is simply another way to say " problem " in Dramatica . <p> Justification is Dramatica 's sophisticated way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside their psyche . Rather than Problem-Solve , a character who justifies buries the inequity deep within the recesses of their mind ... only to have it resurface through the prodding and poking of an Influence Character . <p> The most important part of a complete and effective narrative , the Main Character gives the Audience a way into the story . Leave this perspective out and you will find yourself faced with a cold and lifeless narrative . Embue them with personal baggage that they would take into any story and the Audience will latch onto them . <p> Main Characters have a preference for either trying to solve problems by changing the world around them , or by changing themselves first . If they try to change the world , Dramatica sees them as a Do-er . If they prefer to change themselves first , then we label them a Be-er . Cool fun fact : whatever Approach you choose for the Main Character , the Influence Character will have the opposite one . Boom ! <p> The Main Character Concern can sometimes act as an indicator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . Because we find the Concern on the Type level along with all the other Plot elements , it can sometimes feel like it is a Goal . Really , Concern is just a bigger way of saying Problem . <p> Two parts to a Main Character 's arc : the MC Resolve and the MC Growth . This is the second part , the part that has more to do with the process of arcing from where they are at the beginning of a story to where they are at the end . Main Characters will grow by either dropping an element or gaining a new one . If they drop , they are a Stop character ; if they gain , then they are a Start character . <p> Every character is driven by something . That something is an inequity--a separateness between things--and is inidicated in the narrative by this story point . If the Main Character ends up changing their Resolve and adopting the Influence Character 's paradigm then the Solution to this Problem will be the thing they move towards . If instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolve , then this Problem will actually seem more like source of drive and will be an exceelent way to describe the Main Character . <p> Not enough that we have to determine whether or not the Main Character prefers to solve problems externally or internally through the Main Character Approach , we also have to figure out whether or not the Main Character solves problems linearly like most men , or holistically like most women . Usually this is as simple as selecting the one that most resembles how you yourself solve problems , but you can switch it up to make things more interesting . Setting this does all kinds of things in terms of determining the Act order of different Throughlines . <p> Every Main Character comes to a story with some kind of baggage , some kind of personal problem that gives them grief . Encountering the Influence Character they grow to a point where they have to decide if they were always on the right path and the Influence Character is wrong--or if the IC is right and they need to change their approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then their Resolve is said to be Changed . If instead they maintain their paradigm , then their Resolve is said to be Steadfast . <p> This story point works hand-in-hand with the Main Character Symptom . Whatever the MC thinks their problem is , their Response is what they try and do about it . It is like treating the symptoms of a disease rather than attacking the disease directly--only this disease exists in the mind of the Main Character . <p> This story point demotivates the Main Character by resolving his or her Main Character Problem . Usually only encountered towards the end of a Changed Main Character 's journey , the Solution can show up from time-to-time in a Steadfast Main Character 's journey . When this happens it only temporarily lessens the motivation or drive of the Main Character . Eventually the Problem kicks back in and motivation resumes . <p> All Main Characters have a Problem . This Problem motivates them and drives them to do all kinds of different things that create problems for themselves . But they do n't do anything about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy focusing their attention on the Symptom of the problem instead . It is only towards the end of a narrative that they can finally see the difference between the two . At that point they will make the decision to continue treating the symptoms , or attack the problem directly . <p> The Main Character is that part of a story that reveals an intimate personal look at problem-solving . Covering the personal baggage that exists within the Main Character and the Main Character alone , this Throughline gives an Audience the opportunity to experience act-by-act , the process by which one goes about resolving their personal differences . <p> This story point reflects that unique quality of character that makes it possible for the Main Character to resolve any of the issues within the Overall Story Throughline . Whether an intergral part or attributed to , this Unique Ability ties the Main Charater into the Overall Story and answers the question why he or she needs to be in the story at all . <p> This is what the Main Character Problem-Solving Style used to be called back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linear , a Female setting indicated Holistic . The story point still functions the same--it sets the order of Signposts and other niceties--but it comes in a more easily digestable package now . <p> This is a fancy way of saying how characters do the things they do . One of the four parts of a full developed character ( along with Motivations , Evaluations , and Purposes ) , the Methodology elements of the Overall Story Characters cover things like Proaction , Reaction , Acceptance and Non-Acceptance . <p> Why , oh why wo n't this go away ? Once you understand Dramatica and its concept of the Story Mind , you see the Monomyth and its cousin The Hero 's Journey as a failed attempt to codify the problem-solving process of the human mind . They attach words like Swords and Elixirs and Gateway Guardians because that is what they have seen repeated time and time again in stories . Understanding why they keep reappearing in different cultures requires looking to psychology and Dramatica . <p> The easiest and first thing anyone learns when they first arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what drives them to do the things they do . Motivations like Pursuit and Avoid and Conscience and Temptation tell an Audience what they can expect from that character . The Motivations work in concert with three other aspects of character--Methodologies , Evaluations , and Purposes to help round out the characters in a story . <p> Who wants to write an objective character ? Characters are fun and lively and emotive and interesting--why stifle them with objectivity ? The answer is : characters function as parts of a larger whole , as a part of the Story Mind . Sure , you have Subjective Characters in the Main and Influence Character , but the objective Overall Story Throughline demands objecctive characters . Here , characters are seen less as people , and more as functions within the narrative . <p> Once the Overall Story Problem kicks in and the story begins , the characters in the story will start to become concerned with the Overall Story Concern . Every Throughline exists to offer an opportunity for an Audience to see the Problem of that Throughline in varying degrees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the story 's Problem and the conflict that arises from it . This Concern will receive so much attention that the Overall Story Goal will be of the same Type as the Overall Story Concern . <p> The Overall Story Throughline explores the efforts to resolve the story 's problem at varying degrees of magnification . At the Theme level of the Dramatica Table of Story Elements , the Problem appears as a thematic Issue that measures the relative value of the efforts to resolve that very same Problem . Every Issue comes complete with a matching Counterpoint in order to measure both sides of the argument . <p> This is it . The whole reason why all the characters in a story come into conflict with another . The Overall Story Problem begins with the initial Story Driver and continues until someone resolves it with the Overall Story Solution . Discover this Problem and your story will never falter for a lack of drive . Overall Story points are boring to describe because they 're objective and devoid of emotion . That 's a good thing--no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Overall Story Solution in an effort to resolve the problems created by the Overall Story Problem . Once in place , the story can end with a Story Outcome of Success . Fail to reach it , and the story ends with a Story Outcome of Failure . Overall Story points are lifeless and logical--as they should be . They showcase the objective elements of a narrative . Feeling has no place in objectivity . <p> When you step outside of a story and look at all the characters as " Them " , you are looking at the Overall Story Throughline . From here the characters look more like functions rather than actual people . Protagonist . Antagonist . Guardian and Skeptic . Their roles within the story take center stage from this perspective . When you think of a story , you 're thinking of the Overall Story Throughline . <p> The good guys lose and the Main Character goes home happy . That is the basic definition of a Personal Tragedy story . Mix a Story Outcome of Failure with a Story Judgment of Good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeter side of things . <p> You know that feeling when you finally succeed at something , but you still feel miserable about yourself ? That 's a Personal Triumph story . The good guys win , but the Main Character goes home sad and angst-ridden . Mix a Story Outcome of Success with a Story Judgment of Bad and you get this bittersweet ending that falls more towards the bitter side of things . <p> Is there a difference between Plot-oriented stories and Character-driven stories ? No , that 's a silly idea . Both Plot and Character work together in unison to help support and develop the story 's central argument . Plot Dynamics like the Story Driver , the Story Limit , the Story Outcome , and the Story Judgment help set the stage for the events to come . <p> A Plot Point in Dramatica is essentially one of the Story Drivers that helps turn the story from one Act to the next . You need one to start the story and one to end the story . One to break it up in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story down into four movements , four Acts . You can have more , but you need to have at least these five to define the edges of the story for your Audience . <p> How does a Throughline develop from one Act to the next ? By progression through the four Signposts that define the context of the conflict of that Throughline . Once a story explores all four Signposts , the Audience will know the location of the story problem and how best to solve it . <p> Dramatica features a crazy advanced report that actually shows an Author what the structure of the story looks like to the characters . That is insane . It is one thing to present an objective view of story dynamics and how they all work together , but then to also show what the narrative looks like subjectively is almost too much to handle . Stay away from this report unless you want to cheat . <p> The dramatic circuit of narrative consists of four components : Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome ( or Power ) . Outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' P ' in the anachronym . While not a strict translation of an electric circuit , the analogy exists as a means of communicating the spatial relationship between these components . Combine them together and you create a unit of narrative . <p> Each Throughline exists to provide an Audience an alternative way of looking at the story 's central problem . While this problem can be seen at varying degrees of magnification , the absolute smallest finest resolution at which we can determine this problem is the Problem of that Throughline . Every Problem features its own Solution and a key towards the efforts of the characters in that story to resolve that problem . <p> Problem-Solving is what we do when we are n't involved in Justification--that is , when we 're trying to actually resolve the differences in our lives , rather than trying to hide from them . Interesting fun fact : a linear-thinker 's approach to problem-solving is seen as justification from a holistic-thinker 's point-of-view and vice versa . If that does n't make sense , substitute " man " for linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we can so easily see into each other 's blind spots . <p> When Dramatica first came out , Problem-Solving Style was called Mental Sex--the idea being that men and women solved problems differently . Males approach problems from a Linear point-of-view , while females approach things from a Holistic perspective . Since then , the theory adjusted the Story Point to the less controversial Problem-Solving Style while maintaining the core concept of the idea . Setting this Story Point dictates the order of Signposts within a Throughline . <p> No , this is n't who the story is about . It 's also not the person we care the most about . And it certainly is n't interchangeable with Main Character or Hero . In Dramatica the Protagonist is very clearly defined : that objective character that both Pursues and Considers the Story Goal . Now , sometimes this character can also be the Main Character ( in which case he or she is considered a Hero ) , but it does n't always have to be that way . <p> Everything in Dramatica is based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will begin to notice that everything is broken down into 4s . Four Throughlines , four Signposts , four Character Dynamics , four Plot Dynamics , four Domains , and so on and so fourth ( ! ) . This is because this is how our minds differentiate the external and internal worlds . Know the quad and you will know Dramatica . <p> Elsewhere you will read that this Story Point represents the philosophical argument between Main and Influence Character . Wrong . The Relationship Story Issue of a story is less concerned with an argument between the Main Character and Influence Character and more concerned with the issue that exists in the relationship between these two . If their Issue is Commitment , it does n't mean they will be arguing about Commitment ; it means their relationship will have Commitment issues . <p> Less the source of a problem between them and more a motivator towards engaging in the relationship , the Relationship Story Problem brings Main and Influence Character together . Whether or growing or dissolving relationship , this Problem continues to motivate interaction until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story Solution . <p> The heart of every story . Without this Throughline , a story feels emotionless and concerned more with satisfaction than any real fulfillment . Covering the relationship between the Main Character and the Influence Character , the Relationship Story Throughline is where true emotion happens and where we as an Audience can visit the conflict and attempts to resolve that conflict that exist in the space between us . Once erroneously referred to as the " Main vs . Impact " Throughline , this part of the story is all about the conflict that arises in our relationships with others . <p> In every Throughline there is a Problem that motivates everything . However , the Problem is obscured because the attention is focused on the Symptom of that Problem , not the Problem itself . In an effort to alleviate perceived conflict arising from the Symptom , the Response is taken . <p> These are the smallest chunks of narrative people usually think of when writing a story . Technically , a smaller resolution exists--the Events within a scene--but for most writers , the Scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scenes exist within a Sequence . But the world is not perfect , and neither should a story . Understanding the purpose behind a Scene within the greater argument makes it easier to decide which Scenes to leave in , and which ones to blend into others . <p> Structure is structure regardless of medium , and regardless of size . A short story functions the same way as a " tall " story , only there is n't enough time to explore everything . Take any quad in the Dramatica Table of Story Elements and you have yourself a story . Audiences want to see the entirety of a quad explored . <p> Four Signposts per Throughline , four Acts per storyline . Acts , or Signposts as Dramatica calls them , exist to offer an Audience that chance to see how conflict could possible be resolved within different contexts . Each Throughline breaks down into four different ways to resolve the problems in that storyline . Once all four ways have been explored , the story is over , and the Audience can determine what it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group , the Skeptic represents both the motivation to Oppose everything and to proclaim Disbelief towards any action taken towards the contrary . An Archetypal Character found often in films that play down the importance of characters , the Skeptic is always there to chime in with " Game over , man ! " <p> In every Throughline there exists a Problem . The Solution resolves that problem and restores equity . Unfortunately , there is a certain amount of unawareness to the ' Problem ' in each Throughline as well . Instead , attention focuses on the Symptom of that Problem , and the Response taken to alleviate those symptoms . Eventually both Problem and Symptom are seen for what they really are and a choice is made to continue engaging in the Response or try something new with the Solution . Regardless of the choice made , only the Solution resolves the Problem . <p> SRCA stands for Setup , Revelation , Conflict , and Aftermath . The numbers 1234 can be substituted for SRCA as they both reflect the order in which a dramatic circuit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Storyweaving time-shifting technique found in films like Memento or Pulp Fiction . The order is determined by the storyform and carries with it a unique signature that helps define the story 's dynamics . <p> When you hear that a character " arcs " , the growth of that character 's development is either away from something , or towards something . Believe it or not , those are two very different ways of telling a story . If the character is growing towards something , then their Main Character Growth is Start . <p> In any awesome story , one of the principal characters will stand their ground and stay true to their belief system while the other principal will do a complete 180 . If the Main Character stands their ground , the Influence Character will flip their perspective . If the Influence Character stands their ground , then the Main Character flips--or has their perspective Changed by the Influence Character . This concept explores the latter situation wherein the Main Charcter adopts the Influence Character 's point-of-view . <p> In any awesome story , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their belief system while the other principal will do a complete 180 .

If the Influence Character stands their ground , then the Main Character flips--or has their perspective Changed by the Influence Character . This concept explores the former situation wherein the Influence Character adopts the Main Character 's point-of-view . <p> You can not have a Story Goal without a Story Consequence ; one does not exist without the other . Sometimes referred to as the " stakes " of a story , the Consequence motivates the drive towards a successful resolution in the Overall Story Throughline If you are looking to increase the conflict in your story , the Story Consequence is the first place to look . <p> What starts , stops , and moves a story forward--this is the realm of the Story Driver . Do Actions drive Decisions or do Decisions drive Actions ? The answer is yes .

Some are for it . Some are for against it . Once the initial Story Driver creates the story 's central inequity and Overall Story Problem , the Overall Story Solution becomes apparent . The Story Goal is an attempt to reach that Solution . <p> The Audience wants to know the emotional state of the Main Character at the end of the story . Were the events of the narrative worth it , or are they still troubled and angst-ridden about their personal baggage ? Theoretically speaking this story point reflects the emotional state of the narrative as a whole--meaning , does the Author feel like the efforts to solve the problem were a Good thing or a Bad thing ? <p> You know those films , novels , and plays that seem to go on and on and on with no end in sight ? That 's because they do n't have in place a strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited by Options or Time in the very first Act , remind us in the subsequent Acts , and have the final Option or Second tick away in the last Act . That is how the Audience will know a story is over . Oh . Break the Story Limit by changing it or disrespecting it and the Audience will not forgive you . <p> The nature of a story is either a Work or a Dilemma . On top of this you apply either Actual or Apparent to create a quad of options for this Story Point . Either the characters were right to participate in the Work or the Dilemma , or they were wrong and it only seemed like a Work or a Dilemma . The latter is Apparent , the former Actual . This Story Point is a part of Dramatica 's four Audience Appreciations and is a combination of the Main Character Resolve and the Story Outcome . <p> Usually this is as simple as asking , Do the good guys win or lose ? But sometimes you can run into narratives where the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which case a Success Outcome would feature the bad guys winning . Confusing ? Here 's an easier way . Did the efforts to reach the Story Goal end in Success or Failure ? Answer that and you will know the Story Outcome . <p> Both Author and Audience share a common ground--a thin veil of communication wherein they can see through to each other 's respective point-of-view . These points of commonality are referred to as Story Points and can be found delineated within Dramatica 's concept of the storyform . The clearer your Story Points the more your message will get through to the other side . <p> This is the second stage of the process whereby an Author tries to communicate something of import to an Audience . The first stage is Storyforming where the Author chooses individual Story Points to carry the message out into the world . In this second stage , the Author crafts the Story Points into points unique and personal to his or her own message . In this way , no two stories can be the same even if they maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a collection of 75 story points that form a holistic image of a story 's intended meaning . What does that mean in plain English ? The storyform is a bunch of story points that make up the structure of your story . We say holistic because they all work together--they 're not independent . The current version of Dramatica sees at least 32,767 unique storyforms . There are more , but they require further development and it 's hard enough teaching everyone the current model . <p> Storyforming ? Is that anything like terraforming ? I guess so--if building a story was like building a planet . The Storyforming stage is where an author begins to predict how their story will turn out and what kind of effect it might have on their intended audience . In short , it 's where the Author structures their story . There are three more subsequent phases--Storytelling , Storyweaving , and Story Reception . <p> The Storymind concept rests at the heart of everything that is Dramatica . In short , Dramatica sees every story as a model of a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this model results in story holes or inconsistent and schizophrenic stories . This is one of the givens for the Dramatica theory--if you ca n't buy into this concept then everything that follows is not worth your time . <p> Less about how to tell a story and more about how a story is told , Storytelling in Dramatica is everything that is unique and special to the Author 's creative muse . It is where an Author brings life to lifeless terms like Prerequisites and Preconditions and where the story takes on a life of its own . <p> Every Throughline finds its conflict motivated by a Problem . The only reason this Problem continues to wreck havoc is because the attention of those in the Throughline is focused on the Symptoms of the problem , not the Problem itself . In essence , the Throughline is blind to the Problem because of this focus on the Symptom . <p> Nothing wrong with a tale . Especially if you do n't care about Audience members remembering your tale 48 hours later or you do n't mind them not recommending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , but are soon forgotten as they do n't add up to anything more than what they are . A Complete Story offers so much more than a Tale , and Audiences nowadays are wise to them . <p> Want to know something cool about Theme ? Get this , if a great story is really just an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem , then Theme is really just the evaluations of that single human mind at work . Awesome , right ? Theme is no longer this big imposing intimidating thing--just another aspect of the mind along with Character , Plot , and Genre . <p> Thought , Knowledge , Ability , and Desire function as the base for everything in Dramatica . And when we say everything , we mean everything . From top to bottom , left to right , and everywhere in-between take a quad of four items within the Dramatica Table of Story Elements and you will find equivalents to Thought , Knowledge , Ability , and Desire . Think of these as the building blocks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make everyone in the Audience miserable ? Write a Tragedy .

Put a Story Outcome of Success alongside the equally chipper Story Judgment of Good and you have yourself the makings of a Hollywood blockbuster . Of course , if everyone is making Triumphs who is serving the remaining 75% of storytelling ? <p> Ugh . Who really wastes their time thinking of who the Villain is in there story ? Better to leave that kind of subjective interpretation to the Audience and concentrate on writing a great story .

The story of how a mind arrives at the point where it requires this process is known as backstory . More than a background history lesson , this pre-story story can also be understood as a process of justification . <p> A frequently used example to describe what it means when Dramatica refers to " an inequity between characters and their environment " is the example of the desire for a new car and a car . I use it during my Weekend Workshops and I used it when I used to teach story at CalArts . <p> In short " the desire for a new car is not a problem . A car is not a problem . The desire for a car is not a problem . What does create the potential for a problem is the space between the two : the human mind sees this space as an inequity . When faced with an inequity you have two choices : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Inequity <p> You can resolve the inequity in different ways . For one , you could lose your desire for the new car . Get rid of the desire , no more separateness between things , no more inequity . Everything returns to Zen . OR you can get the car . Get the car , you no longer have a desire for it , no more space in-between , no more inequity , everything returns to normal . <p> But what if you do n't  have the means for a car AND you cant get rid of the desire ? That 's when you start the justification process . <h> Justifying the Inequity <p> When deciding the alternate path of justification , your mind first looks to see where it is going to focus its attention . Let 's say you focus on the car . If you do that , then you " lock " the desire for the car away " you 're no longer going to consider losing that desire as an option . Your attention is focused on the car . <p> With the desire locked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have a car and that frustrates the heck out of you . The car is now a problem only because your mind determined it was n't going to reconsider the desire . This is where the Justification process begins and where Dramatica fits in . <h> A Process for Solving Problems <p> The Dramatica model is n't showing you the inequity , the model is showing you the minds problem-solving process . With the car as a problem , you automatically create a solution : more cash . Now you have a Problem ( the car ) and a Solution ( more cash ) . But what if you do n't  have enough cash ? Well then , you make not having cash a Problem by hiding that First Problem of not having a car . Youve justified or hidden away that Problem and created a new Problem .

The next step in the cycle is where you 'll find Steadfast Main Characters ; their stories tell the process of building justifications up . <p> The storyform is n't about an inequity , but rather the minds process of problem-solving or justifying a problem that came from an inequity between things .

While some prefer to see the templates of commonality within story , the real key to unique storytelling lies in understanding the power of perspective . <p> The last two articles in this series on Conflict introduced the idea of the Four Throughlines and the Four Major Areas of Conflict . By attaching a Throughline ( or perspective ) to one of these areas , an Author sets up the personality of the story . The article Familiar Patterns of Story Structure covered the prevailing structural arrangement , or personality , found in most American films . Why do Star Wars , The Matrix , Die Hard , How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar seem familiar ? Beyond beat sheets and mythical stages , these films focus their storytelling on the same kind of conflict . This similarity guides them into the same structural Genre . <p> The Main Character finds themselves personally faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Fixed Attitude . The Relationship between the two revolves around their Problematic Ways of Thinking and the Overall Story examines Problematic Activities as a whole . <p> But what would happen if we simply flipped the Main Character and Influence Character positions ? Would it feel any different than the films listed above ? The Overall Story Throughline would still lie in Activity so it shouldnt make a difference , right ? . There would still be the usual kicking , stealing , fighting , grabbing and killing . But what if the Main Character was suddenly facing a problem of Attitude rather than a problem of Situation like their status in life or physicality ? <p> What would that film feel like ? <h> Casablanca and the Main Character <p> For starters , you might end up with this 1942 classic that many consider one of the best films of the 20th century . Like Star Wars , The Matrix , Avatar and Kung Fu Panda , Casablanca focuses its Overall Story Throughline on Problematic Activities . How else would one categorize the problems found in hiding stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And like most action films , both the Main Character and Influence Character in Casablanca find themselves in a battle over how each other thinks ( Problematic Ways of Thinking ) . If only Ilsa could convince Rick to change his mind about her and about those visas , perhaps things could work out for them . <p> And this gives us a bit of a clue as to why Ricks Throughline fits better in Fixed Attitude rather than the Situational area of conflict . Rick has no problem with the way he looks , with where he is living , or his status within Casablanca . What Rick does have though is a very bad , very sour attitude . " I stick my neck out for no one , " tells of a rather opinionated Main Character . Most importantly though , is that this opinion creates major problems for him . It is where he will have to do the most growing as a character . <p> What about Ilsa as a Situation Influence Character ? Besides being the most beautiful woman in the world ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilsas status as the wife of a selfless freedom fighter gives Ricks bad attitude a moment of pause . How can he keep this facade up when this person stuck in an untenable position is willing to give of herself for others ? <p> As you can see , this structural setup has a slightly different personality from the films covered in the last article . Instead of focusing on all the problems Rick creates because of what he is doing ( like Luke or Po ) , the emphasis here lies in what Rick is not doing . Getting Rick to stick his neck out ? That 's what the whole story tries to prove is a good thing . <h> Fixated Fish <p> And that same dynamic , that same cause for growth in Rick , orbits around Marlin in Pixars Finding Nemo . Like the saloon owner in Northern Africa , father Marlin struggles with a strict mindset : he knows what his son can and can not do . The constant worrying and obsessing over safety ? That 's a Fixed Attitude that creates problems personally for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nemo ? His one-fin handicap puts him smartly in the Situation Throughline . This impacts Marlins attitude , shines a light on fathers blind spot , and calls for certain character growth . If what Marlin believes is true , that his son ca n't do these things , then why on Earth can the little guy keep proving that he can ? Surely one of them must be wrong <p> Like Rick , it is not so much what Marlin is doing that is causing him grief , but rather what he wo n't open himself up to . Give that little guy some distance and look what he can do . This is how rigid opinions change their course in stories of adventure . <h> Off the Beaten Path <p> There is nothing wrong with the familiar Situational Main Character , but as you can see , a different kind of story exists where the central character finds themselves at the mercy of an opinion . Finding Nemo and Casablanca are n't  exactly bargain-bin disasters ; they 're both masterworks of storytelling that will continue to prevail long after were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to shift the attitudes of an Audience simply by the juxtaposition of perspective and problem .

When they are in this vertical alignment ( with the OS in Activity and the MC in Fixed Attitude ) , the Main Character will feel as if they have a " hole in their heart . " <p> Dramatica refers to this important structural concept as the Main Character Growth and gives two choices : Stop or Start . With the Throughlines arranged as above , the Growth is Start .

Established by geek screenwriter John August and fellow Cal-Arts alum Stu Maschwitz , Fountain extends Markdown to include special affordances for the screenplay format : <p> Fountain supports everything a screenwriter is likely to need in the early , creative phases of writing .

Slugline walks the line between text and screenplay by formatting your text file as you write to give the appearance of a completed screenplay . <p> Personally , I find Highland to be the better of the two .

Starting with a basic idea , an afternoon spent with the program can result in a thematically rich and engaging narrative . The struggle comes in translating these elaborate and detailed story points into something someone can readand enjoy . <p> Dramatica ships with a Scene Creation feature built into the program . Tucked away within the StoryGuide window , the Scene Creation section allows Authors to create scenes and attach relevant Story Points to them . You can title each scene , write a brief description , and along the bottom select the points that will come into play within this scene . A numerical counter in parenthesis at the end of each Story Point keeps track of how many times it has been referenced . <p> The general idea is to have each Story Point show up once per Act . Any more and you risk repeating yourself . Any less and you risk leaving a hole in your story . This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story Point and not completely destroy your narrative . The important part is to be conscious of what is in there and what is not in there . That way you 'll know how to fix it if someone feels that something is missing or that a scene comes off superfluous . <h> A Better Outliner <p> The Scene Creation feature is functional and it is nice that you can print out a Treatment with Structure Report that lists out the scenes and their attached Story Pointsalong with any specific Story Encoding you have written . Unfortunately the format of the report is fixed and even more unfortunatelyDramatica Story Expert is still not mobile friendly . In 2016 . So any outlining work you want to do has to be done sitting at a desktop or with a giant laptop in front you . <p> Last year we spoke of writing everywhere and anywhere in a format that is transportable across all platforms . We still write that way and still find it to be the most productive approach . Yet that desire to bridge the gap between the work done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find better and better ways of outlining . You can work forever and ever in Dramatica , adjusting storyforms , assigning character elements , and imagining greater and greater thematically rich scenes . <p> But eventually you have to write the thing . <h> The Evolution of Outlining <p> In the beginning we simply Exported to Screenwriter . Movie Magic Screenwriter is a fantastic WYSIWYG screenwriting program with a powerful Outlining feature along the left side . Importing a Dramatica DR5 file creates the scenes you specified in the Scene Creation window and attaches notes for each of the Story Points . It does n't  bring over the Story Encoding information . <p> Again , this is functionalbut its not very sexy . In addition , keeping track of multiple Throughlines becomes burdensome with a linear approach like this . You simply ca n't look at a wall-sized map through a peephole lens ; eventually you lose the context . <p> In came Outliner4D ( then called StoryView ) and a structuralists prayers were answered . <p> Outliner4D is so powerful that it would take several articles to explain all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outline and Timeline . The Outline is your typical top-down approach to outlining . You create nested lists of Acts , Sequences , and Scenes just like you would in any other program . The real magic happens when you switch to Timeline view . <p> In Timeline view you get a horizontally scrolling zoom-able view of your storys events . You can step back and look at the story as a whole or you can even zoom in and focus on a particular Scene or Sequence . The width or space each scene takes up is based on the Type and Amount of Duration you set for each item . Hamlet here was set to Number of Lines and you can see how Scene 1 consists of 190 lines whereas Scene 2 consists of 180 lines . Pull out and you might see that Scene 2 of Act 2 is 617 lines . <p> This is where Outliner4D shines . <p> Having a thematically rich story is one thing . Knowing the pacing and rhythm of that thematically rich storythats quite another , and equally as important . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your story . Feel like your first Act is taking too long ? Well now you can see how it compares to subsequent Acts and adjust the timing of each Scene accordingly . <p> Every screenwriter knows that one page of a screenplay equates to approximately one minute of screentime . Often they divide their story into three sections ( Acts ) with the first and last approximately half the length of the second . Entering the Duration of each Scene into Outliner4D would be a time-consuming and mundane processwhich is why the creators of Outliner4D gave us the ability to write a screenplay within the program itself . Using the same engine found in Movie Magic Screenwriter , Outliner4D automatically calculates the length of each scene in minutes and adjusts its length on the timeline ! <p> I once wrote an entire screenplay in Outliner4D ( StoryView ) and the effect it had on my writing was palpable . Seeing the rhythm of each Scene in context with the Sequences above and the Acts above that had a visceral impact on my story . I knew when my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to stretch things out in the second Act to keep that rhythm consistent . <p> Nothing else comes close . But there 's one more feature that pushes Outliner4D into another realm . <h> Tracking Story Points <p> While the visual representation of the rhythm of a story is a productive and thought-provoking tool , the ability to track Story Points across several scenes in a visual makes Outliner4D the outlining tool for Dramatica writers . <p> The Track Area that runs along the bottom of the Timeline view allows Authors to keep track of characters , story points , and events throughout the course of their story . You simply drag from the scene down to a Story Point and the connection is made . Instead of a simple numerical value appended to the end of an event , the Track Area offers a visual representation of the frequency of a Story Point . The effect is a confidence builder : want to make sure you 're taking care of that Relationship Throughline that feels like it wanes somewhere in the middle of the 2nd Act ? Track it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you 're not losing sight of the Main Character Throughlines Symptom and Response ? Track those and make sure they happen enough times so that the Audience understands exactly what it is the Main Character is experiencing . <p> For instance , let 's say you 're writing Godfather II and want to see what Scenes deal with Michael and Kay Growing Apart . Simply click on the corresponding Track below and Outliner4D automatically hides those Scenes that have nothing to do with Michael and Kaye . You can see that they occupy a lot of time during the first half of the film but then ramp off during the second . If you felt you needed another scene of their relationship dissolving you might attack it somewhere in that 160-190 page area.1 <p> Outliner4D is made by the same people who made Movie Magic Screenwriter and the same people who made Dramaticawhich means they work seamlessly together .

@@119273258 @8273258/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Not-So Familiar Patterns of Story Structure <p> Crafting a story that examines conflict from a different angle challenges the expectations of an Audience familiar with the same old thing . While some prefer to see the templates of commonality within story , the real key to unique storytelling lies in understanding the power of perspective . <p> The last two articles in this series on Conflict introduced the idea of the Four Throughlines and the Four Major Areas of Conflict . By attaching a Throughline ( or perspective ) to one of these areas , an Author sets up the personality of the story . The article Familiar Patterns of Story Structure covered the prevailing structural arrangement , or personality , found in most American films . Why do Star Wars , The Matrix , Die Hard , How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar seem familiar ? Beyond beat sheets and mythical stages , these films focus their storytelling on the same kind of conflict . This similarity guides them into the same structural Genre . <p> The Main Character finds themselves personally faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Fixed Attitude . The Relationship between the two revolves around their Problematic Ways of Thinking and the Overall Story examines Problematic Activities as a whole . <p> But what would happen if we simply flipped the Main Character and Influence Character positions ? Would it feel any different than the films listed above ? The Overall Story Throughline would still lie in Activity so it shouldnt make a difference , right ? . There would still be the usual kicking , stealing , fighting , grabbing and killing . But what if the Main Character was suddenly facing a problem of Attitude rather than a problem of Situation like their status in life or physicality ? <p> What would that film feel like ? <h> Casablanca and the Main Character <p> For starters , you might end up with this 1942 classic that many consider one of the best films of the 20th century . Like Star Wars , The Matrix , Avatar and Kung Fu Panda , Casablanca focuses its Overall Story Throughline on Problematic Activities . How else would one categorize the problems found in hiding stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And like most action films , both the Main Character and Influence Character in Casablanca find themselves in a battle over how each other thinks ( Problematic Ways of Thinking ) . If only Ilsa could convince Rick to change his mind about her and about those visas , perhaps things could work out for them . <p> And this gives us a bit of a clue as to why Ricks Throughline fits better in Fixed Attitude rather than the Situational area of conflict . Rick has no problem with the way he looks , with where he is living , or his status within Casablanca . What Rick does have though is a very bad , very sour attitude . " I stick my neck out for no one , " tells of a rather opinionated Main Character . Most importantly though , is that this opinion creates major problems for him . It is where he will have to do the most growing as a character . <p> What about Ilsa as a Situation Influence Character ? Besides being the most beautiful woman in the world ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilsas status as the wife of a selfless freedom fighter gives Ricks bad attitude a moment of pause . How can he keep this facade up when this person stuck in an untenable position is willing to give of herself for others ? <p> As you can see , this structural setup has a slightly different personality from the films covered in the last article . Instead of focusing on all the problems Rick creates because of what he is doing ( like Luke or Po ) , the emphasis here lies in what Rick is not doing . Getting Rick to stick his neck out ? That 's what the whole story tries to prove is a good thing . <h> Fixated Fish <p> And that same dynamic , that same cause for growth in Rick , orbits around Marlin in Pixars Finding Nemo . Like the saloon owner in Northern Africa , father Marlin struggles with a strict mindset : he knows what his son can and can not do . The constant worrying and obsessing over safety ? That 's a Fixed Attitude that creates problems personally for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nemo ? His one-fin handicap puts him smartly in the Situation Throughline . This impacts Marlins attitude , shines a light on fathers blind spot , and calls for certain character growth . If what Marlin believes is true , that his son ca n't do these things , then why on Earth can the little guy keep proving that he can ? Surely one of them must be wrong <p> Like Rick , it is not so much what Marlin is doing that is causing him grief , but rather what he wo n't open himself up to . Give that little guy some distance and look what he can do . This is how rigid opinions change their course in stories of adventure . <h> Off the Beaten Path <p> There is nothing wrong with the familiar Situational Main Character , but as you can see , a different kind of story exists where the central character finds themselves at the mercy of an opinion . Finding Nemo and Casablanca are n't  exactly bargain-bin disasters ; they 're both masterworks of storytelling that will continue to prevail long after were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to shift the attitudes of an Audience simply by the juxtaposition of perspective and problem .

" <p> Dramatica refers to this important structural concept as the Main Character Growth and gives two choices : Stop or Start . With the Throughlines arranged as above , the Growth is Start .

Understanding Authors Intent would be impossible if it werent for tiny pinholes piercing that veil . <h> Meaning and Prediction . <p> You cant have them bothnot at the same time from the same perspective . <p> Authors predict . Audiences appreciate meaning . If you 're predicting you 're not appreciating meaning , and if experiencing meaning , you 're not predicting . This is the dilemma facing everyone trying to tell a story : I can predict what I want to say , but I 'll never know the true meaning of what I write . We predict in order to write and we search for meaning in order to rewrite . The cycle continues on and on until finally we cant take it anymore . <p> Unless there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously be on both sides of that bookcase at the end of Interstellar .

Possible only in the context of a tesseract designed by a future civilization ? <p> Something like that . <h> Where Authors Run Into Trouble <p> I have a prediction , what does it mean ? <p> This is the single biggest problem Authors have when they write and when they are first introduced to the Dramatica theory of story . They are so accustomed to asking What does it mean ? that fail to see Dramatica for what it is : a tool for prediction . <p> If you 're going to predict , you have to establish the meaning up front . Meaning is the baseline for prediction . I know what this means so therefore I can predict it . <p> By definition then , you cant do both prediction and meaning at the same time . You cant ask what does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use at context for prediction : I think X and Y is good , therefore I can predict what is going to happen . Prediction is what you stand on and use for context in order to appreciate meaning : I predict this is how things are going to turn out , now I can look around and see what it means , by how it compares to the prediction I made . <p> The Dramatica theory of story can help with the second approach . <h> A Method for Prediction <p> With Dramatica , you have a storyform . The storyform is a collection of seventy-five story points that work together holistically to form the message behind the narrative . No one point takes precedence over the other , no one point is essential . Yet , enough points are needed to effectively communicate the Authors Intent . <p> A storyform is a method of predicting story points . With storyform in hand , an Author can then look back and establish the meaning of that storyform by evaluating it in terms of how it is received . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story points . To do so would be an effort to distort definitions chosen and established by the creators of the theory as a means of predicting story points needed to tell a complete story . <p> The Dramatica theory of story specifically identifies key story points and relationships between story points so that Authors can begin to confidently predict elements of their story . <p> For instance , in a world where the Main Character is going to be a Do-er or Be-er and the Influence Character is going to be the Dynamic Oppositewhich is a given in the current model of Dramaticathen if one picks what the Main Character Approach is , one will automatically know what the Influence Character Approach is going to be . One can make that prediction because Dramatica has already predefined those meanings . <p> I have a prediction , what does it mean ? You cant do both in the same context .

This is one of the reasons whywhen you are storyformingit is so hard to understand what it means . It is hard to understand what the audience is going to experience simply by looking at a storyform . <p> And that is because storyforming is predicting . <p> An Author selects Success for the Story Outcome and Good for the Story Judgment . She wants it to end in a Triumph . That is prediction . Meaning is experience . <h> Rare Focal Points Along the Veil <p> The story points found in the storyform are those rare focal points seen by both Author and Audience . Within that veil that exists between the two , there are these very specific holes in very specific places that have very specific meanings . Those are the story points . <p> If you look from the Authors side and you look from the Audiences side you are pretty much seeing the same thing .

Data analysts at the Computational Story Lab at the University of Vermont in Burlington have unearthed the six basic emotional arcs of storytelling : <p> Their method is straightforward . The idea behind sentiment analysis is that words have a positive or negative emotional impact . So words can be a measure of the emotional valence of the text and how it changes from moment to moment . So measuring the shape of the story arc is simply a question of assessing the emotional polarity of a story at each instant and how it changes . <p> The science behind this study is interesting , but I 'm not sure how exactly useful it is for Authors . How does one translate the emotional polarity of the words they write ? This appears to be something that can only be performed after the fact . <p> A steady , ongoing rise in emotional valence , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis Carroll . A steady ongoing fall in emotional valence , as in a tragedy such as- Romeo and Juliet . A fall then a rise , such as the man-in-a-hole story , discussed by Vonnegut . A rise then a fall , such as the Greek myth of- Icarus . Rise-fall-rise , such as- Cinderella . Fall-rise-fall , such as- Oedipus . <p> Both the ongoing rise in emotional valence and the steady ongoing fall in emotional valence sound like stories with a bump-bump-bump plot progression . In Dramatica this bump in emotion happens when the Throughline traverses horizontally or vertically from Act to Act . <p> While we do n't  have an analysis of Alices Adventures Underground , we do have one for Romeo and Juliet . Sure enough , the plot progression for Romeos Throughlinealbeit , the most emotionally charged Throughlineis a bump-bump-bump plot progression . <p> Where Dramatica diverges from research like this , and proves to be an invaluable tool for Authors , is in the practical application of this rise in emotional valence . If you wanted to write Romeo and Juliet , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional baggage by moving from Impulsive Responses to Memories to Innermost Desires to Contemplations . <p> Fall then a rise and rise then a fall sounds like a slide-bump-slide story . Again we do n't  have research on Icarus , but a film like Amadeus fits that nicely . A slide occurs when the Throughline traverses diagonally and Salieri does that in the first half of that story and again during the second half . <p> It is always fascinating to me how all this research is done into the science of narrative , yet no one mentions the Dramatica theory of story . Seems like everyone could save themselves a ton of time if they took a closer look at the theory .

In Dramatica theory , the Main Character is not always the Protagonist and in fact , many great stories separate out these two roles into separate characters.1 <p> Yet in the case of Bourne , Kyle , Cage , and Deckard they do function as Protagonists . Why then the focus on their internal problem-solving ?

Now , before you skip ahead and simply put down " Act 1 " , " Act 2 " , " Act 3 " were going to use the power of Dramatica to help tell us if we have a three Act story . Some stories take three Acts to tell , some take four , some simply take two . <p> Every Throughline in Dramatica consists of four Concerns that cover the types of conflict in each Throughline .

If you have a Bump-Slide-Bump then you have a typical Three-Act structure .

Old Joes capture bumps the story into the last movement wherein Old Joe finally understands Cids abilities and Young Joe understands what he has to do to save the future ( Understanding ) . <p> If , on the other hand , you have something like this : <p> Signpost 1 : Understanding <p> Signpost 2 : Learning <p> Signpost 3 : Doing <p> Signpost 4 : Obtaining <p> then you 'll organize your document like this : <p> # Act 1 <p> # Act 2 <p> because you have what is known as a Slide-Bump-Slide story , or Two-Act story . These stories feel like they consist of two major movements . Some refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Camerons Aliens takes this approach : the first movement consists of understanding what happened to the Lost Colony and slides into learning what really happened ( " Theyre coming outta the goddman walls !

" ) . Understanding to Learning and then Doing to Obtaining . <p> Lastly , if you have this : <p> Understanding <p> Obtaining <p> Learning <p> Doing <p> then get ready , because you have a Bump-Bump-Bump-Bump story and you will want to organize your story like this : <p> # Act 1 <p> # Act 2 <p> # Act 3 <p> # Act 4 <p> These narratives feel more episodic in nature .

If the Main Character somehow musters up the courage to react differently , to try a different method for solving their personal issues , then it becomes obvious that the Main Character has resolved to change their approach . <p> Think of this technique as the Authors Proof of Resolve , rather than simply another instance of " framing device " or bookend . Beyond simply showing that something has " changed " or providing a context within which to appreciate the story , this sophisticated use of a framing device comes with the prime intent of helping an Author confidently prove the message of their story . <h> Proving the Authors Argument <p> Referring again to last weeks article , The Godfather uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the beginning he has no problem explaining the family business to Kaye . At the end , he lies to her face about it . He changes from a man driven by his feelings about the mafia to a man driven by the cold-hearted logic necessary to keep his family business alive . <p> Presented with the same set of circumstances , Michael has changed the way he approaches that problem . The two scenes prove his resolve . <p> In Top Gun , the aptly named Maverick ( Tom Cruise ) is a lone wolf , jumping into action at the drop of a hat , completely disregarding any responsibility he might have towards others . He starts the story abandoning his wingman in order to flip over and flip off a Russian pilot , complete with a Polaroid snapshot . The result ? His terrified wingman almost loses his life on final approach . <p> At the end of the film , Mav finds himself in the same exact situation , only this time he refuses to leave his wingman . Proof of resolve once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues plaguing them . Top Gun is not Shakespeare or as well-crafted as The Godfather but the concept remains just as effectivethe Author conveys their message clearly and succintly . Control your impulses and you too can experience triumph . <p> In The Shawshank Redemption , Reds proof of resolve sequence so clearly defines itself by happening in the same exact room ! Facing the parole board at the beginning of the story we can easily see what the system has done to poor Red ( Morgan Freeman ) . Beaten down , he cowardly grasps hat in hand and nods Yessir , whatever you say sir . Telling the board what he thinks they want to hear , he recevies his rejection notice with ease . <p> At the end , having gone through a lifetime of growth experience with Andy ( Tim Robbins ) , he vehemently stands his ground and speaks up and out at them . No longer content with simply towing the system line , Red defies authority and in turn gains their respect . His stamp of approval is the Authors proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you too may find freedom . <h> More To It Than Simply Change <p> Bookends or framing devices are not revolutionary new concepts in storytelling . The revolution exists in understanding how they work and how best to apply them . <p> Save the Cat ! creator Blake Snyder refers to bookends in the explanations of his Opening and Final Image : <p> These are bookends . And because a good screenplay is about change , these two scenes are a way to make clear how that change takes place in your moviethe final image in a movie is the opposite of the opening image . It is your proof that change has occurred and that its real <p> This is a reasonable assessment from the Audiences point-of-view ( covered in Forget the Cat , Save Yourself ! ) , but as an Author , why do these scenes of correlation exist and how can one create meaning out of them ? <p> If the framing devices show the Main Characters change in approach ( or lackequally as important ! ) towards solving his own personal issues , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Characters final resolve . It is more than simply showing change because good screenplays are about change , it is supporting the Authors message , solidifying their original reason for writing . Crafting scenes like this simply becomes a matter of understanding the problem at the heart of the Main Characters personal throughline and creating scenes that exploit it . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Dramatica gives an Author with the key elements central to a Main Characters Throughline . In the case of Red , Support is his Problem with Oppose falling in as the appropriate Solution . The parole board scenes give a perfect opportunity for the Author to show how Reds willingness to fall in line can be " fixed " by speaking out and opposing their way of doing things . <p> If instead Red had been a Steadfast character , that final parole board scene would have him responding the same way he did in the beginning , supporting their every word . <p> Now , the story is n't set up for that to make sense , but in a completely different story an Author could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resolve an issue of institutional thinking .

If released because of it , then the Authors message would be clear and a bit subversive , be a yes man and you can be free . <p> If instead , he received his final rejection notice and went back to his cell head down , the message would come from the same point-of-view , yet be a completely miserable and downer experience . Tow the line and you 'll end up a sad and lonely man ! Sad message , but a clear one to be sure .

Trapped in a small box and surrounded by others sharing the great misery , writers cant help but be creative . Discovering this truth and the joy it brought to the artists in my family , I felt it beneficial to share our experience . <h> Robots and Segregation <p> It all began with an idea . My 13-year old daughter , laptop at hand , called from the backseat and requested that I help her write a story . Having failed to install Dramatica prior to our journey and lacking the necessary protocols for tethering , 1 my aspiring writer needed assistance getting her story started on the right foot . <p> She knew the subject matter to be robots and segregation , but she was n't sure how to begin .

A grape can be round or a grape can be green , its meaningor truthlies in the context taken by the viewer . Insoluble arguments occur over differing contexts , not over opposites . You can imagine one character arguing incessantly that the grape is round while another demands that the grape is green . Look at it , its round ! Are you insane ? ! Its green ! On and on this goes until one finally sees things from the others point-of-view . <p> The same dynamic can be found between the Main Character and Influence Character of a story . The argument between them is n't so much about seeing different things as it is seeing the same thing from different points of view .

How does my daughter start writing her story of prejudice and automation ? <h> Crafting an Argument <p> The key to generating this effective conflict is finding a truism that works from a particular context , then juxtapose it with an alternate truism from a different point-of-view . Put them together in one room and you have conflict . <h> Step 1 : Identify A Truth <p> The first thing to do us to single out a truth . It does n't  have to be the truth . Only a truth . Your truth if you will . <p> People need . Ask yourself , what do people need ? <p> My daughter balked at first . At thirteen she still struggles with the self-confidence necessary to express oneself . So I offered my own : <p> People need to eat . <p> That works .

I pushed the needle on this one : <p> People need to eat in order to stay sane unless arriving early to make Grandma happy is more important <p> Two truths that can not exist in the same space and time .

You do it several more times until it becomes second nature . <p> People need to chill in order to be happy unless they need conflict to feel better about themselves . <p> My daughter came up with this one and the next .

This basic understanding of generating conflict rests in all of useven 10-year oldsas it is based on the psychology of our minds . It just takes our older more-developed minds a little more time to get back to where we started . <p> My daughter rose to the challenge : <p> People need to respect other peoples beliefs in order to grant acceptance unless people prefer their privacy . <p> Perfect .

Unfamiliar with the refugee situation here and abroad , my daughter crafts an argument that resonates beyond robots and times to come . By juxtaposing two truths , she established the potential for meaningful narrative . <p> I did n't  hear much from her after that ; she was too busy writing . <h> A Basis for Momentum <p> Great narrative positions one truth against another .

Wouldnt it be great to have the foresight ahead of time to know what path to take and what important points to explore ? <h> Diving Into One of the Greats <p> Recently , I had the pleasure of conducting an analysis of the Iranian masterpiece , A Separation ( 2011 ) . In addition to the superb acting and deft directing , the film exudes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid storyform . <p> A storyformas defined by the Dramatica ( narrative science ) theory of storyidentifies the central thematic elements of a complete narrative . Listing close to seventy-five key story points , this structural imprint holds within it the meaning or " message " of a story . Analyzing a film by looking for these key story points allows writers to better understand how to apply the predictive nature of the storyform to their own work . <h> The First Go-Round <p> I originally completed my first analysis of this spectacular film last September . The storyform I settled on at that time wasfor the most partaccurate , but there were a few areas where it did n't  feel quite right to me . A proper storyform sings outlike an orchestra playing together in harmonious brillianceand this one did n't  quite ring true to me . A few sour notes that left me feeling a bit off . <p> So when it came time to take another crack at it in one of my Story classes at the California Institute of the Arts , I jumped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75% of this second attempt ended up matching my initial assessment , I did make one slight adjustment . I say slight because its an easy thing to do within the software application , but theoretically , it 's actually a pretty major shift . Instead of seeing Naders problems as a matter of his obstinate attitudewhich he clearly haswe looked at him from the perspective of his manipulations . Every problem he has , everything that defines who he is , comes as a result of his constant drive to change the way people think and how they think about him . More importantly though , this way of thinking causes problems for him . Shifting the context of his personal Throughline to something more psychological in naturewhile a simple click of the mousein reality , opened up a whole new perspective on his personal troubles . <p> Drilling down into Dramatica 's structural model beneath this psychological " umbrella " we eventually struck narrative gold : <p> This quad of elements sang out for a couple of reasons . The first was the word Causenamely because that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial analysis . Dramatica defines Cause as : <p> the specific circumstances that lead to an effect . The character containing the Cause characteristic is concerned with what is behind a situation or its circumstances . <p> Naders problems stem from his overwhelming desire to establish blame and from his desire to avoid taking any blame for anything . His wife leaving him , Raziehs " accident " , why Razieh was even there in the first place : all of these exemplify a character driven and blinded by Cause . <p> More importantly , however , this quad stood out because the elements within sang together in a harmonious reflection of Nader . Like the entire storyform itselfalbeit at a finer resolutionthese elements grouped together holistically painted a picture of Nader 's flawed character I 'm sure the Author intended . <h> A Holistic Model of Intent <p> In short , the storyform defines what it is the Author is trying to say with his or her work .

But when it comes to films that really matter , the ones that strive to be something even greater than the sum total of their parts , concepts like the storyform help explain why the greatness . <h> The Magic of Dramatica <p> By selecting Cause as Naders Main Character Problem , Dramatica took the initiative and calculated the rest of the thematic material needed to tell a compelling story . Yes , that 's right . The power of Dramatica , and its unique ability over any other paradigm of story , lies in its ability to take the parts of your story you know and provide with the bits you have n't even thought of yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict what you need in the other Throughlines in order to balance out your story and make it feel complete . <p> All that was left now was to take a look at what Dramatica predicted the Overall Story Throughline of A Separation to be and see if that matched up with the actual film : <p> Amazing ! If there was one thing clear about the Overall Story of this filmthe part of the story that affects everyoneit was the broken system of justice within Iran . Proving one 's innocence within the judge 's small cramped office , waiting amongst the hoarded outside to even get inall of these perfectly illustrated an Overall Story Problem of Process : <p> the mechanism through which a cause leads to an effect . A Process is a series of interactions that create results . syn. chain of interactions , manner of procedure , cause/effect relation , progression , ongoing pull or tendency <p> This was yet another key point I had selected in my original analysis . You may wonder then , if the Overall Story Problem and the Main Character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember that " slight " shift in perspective I made earlier ? By doing this , the other two items in both quads switched from Proven and Un-proven to Accurate and Non-Accurate . <p> In my original analysis I had felt the former pair ( Proven and Un-Proven ) correctly identified what a majority of the story was about . While the individual Problems of the Throughlines drive a story forward , it is the other pair within the quad that occupies most of the story 's attention . The characters in A Separation certainly spend a fair amount of time trying to prove the unproven . <p> But when one takes a closer look at Accurate and Non-Accurate and sees them more as Appropriate Behavior and Inappropriate Behavior ( synonyms respectively ) one begins to gain a greater sense of what the film was really exploring thematically . Nader calling out the hot-headed husband Hodjat for insulting him , Hodjat yelling at his Razieh for working for a single man , or Razieh calling up her religious order to determine whether or not helping an ailing old man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an appropriate action for her to takeall of these describe characters balancing the demands of appropriate and inappropriate behavior .

Imagine trying to drag the MC Domain of a Do-er down into Fixed Attitude or Manipulation only to have it snap back into place in Situation or Activity ... Or dragging and dropping characters into the Build Characters window ... Or being able to rotate around the model in 3D ... Ugh , if only there was an extra me I would do it in a second ! <p> Mike Wollaeger , Dramatica Story Expert and all-around nice guy , had some excellent advice for writers new to Dramatica : <p> The first time I used Dramatica to storyform a screenplay I was writing , I misunderstood about 90% of everything I was doing . Repetition and throwing yourself headfirst into testing out your understanding ( and dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move forward . <p> This is the same experience I had . I did n't understand how a story could be about anything else but Obtaining . Of course every story is about achieving something , what else could it be ? Subsequently , I 've discovered the difference between the energy to resolve a goal and the actual type of Goal , but absolutely , you have to go into Dramatica knowing you 're not going to get it the first couple of years . <p> It 's been almost 20 years for me and I 'm just now understanding the Relationship Throughline . Your mileage may vary . <p> If I could do it again , I would do the impossible , which is focus on fewer things in the theory until I had them down cold . I would be sure to be able to cleave apart the MC and the Protagonist . Even if , especially if , they are played by the same person . I would aim to distinguish Do-ers from Be-ers . I would try to break stories down into their Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I could determine Success &amp; Failure . <p> This is a fantastic list and really should be the only things newbies see when they first dive into Dramatica . Learn these and then move on to the more complicated stuff . <p> The tricky part here is that it 's hard to know if you 've done it right if this is all you focus on . If you try to carry a story all the way to the bottom , then the model starts to fight back if you 've got something wrong . At the high levels , there is no feedback yet . <p> Perfect advice . Not sure why I did n't see this before but you can be sure I will take this approach with new writers in the future . <p> He left the best advice for last : <p> Also , bear in mind that Dramatica will help your story , but it will not help you write . So keep writing , daily , while you learn Dramatica . <p> He David Fincher , along with Mike De Luca and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save that ending , and they are the reason that that ending was maintained and is the ending that 's in the movie . Without them , no one was going to listen to me , the lowly screenwriter " that 's just the way it goes . <p> Because who would know better whether or not an ending works well thematically with everything that came before it then the guy who has spent the past couple of years going over it with a fine tooth comb . <p> The ending of Se7en had to be what it was because everything prior led up to that moment . Pity 's character was a hot head and it was Morgan 's character who constantly kept him in check . It was only once Morgan finally had his moment of impulsiveness ( the slapping of John Doe ) that Pitt 's character was finally allowed off his chain . Those moments meant something . As despicable as Doe 's actions were , they were n't a threat as long as more level-headed men were around . <p> Once that departed , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains shining example of why it is important to have a purposeful complete narrative first . And why it is important to fight every step of the way for that story . <p> Phenomenal storytelling under the stars at the annual Dreamworks Animation TV Movie Under the Stars event . This year 's film was The Iron Giant ( non-director 's cut ) , a great reminder that complete storytelling endures . <p> Produced screenwriter and former Sony Studios story analyst Ken Miyamoto has this to say about Dramatica in a Quora answer : <p> Film Theorists have one thing going for them ... hindsight. - They can look at a film or screenplay and pretty much dissect it any way they 'd like , in order to fit it in whatever formula or directive they are preaching. - <p> Ken is way off track here . Chris and Melanie developed Dramatica without looking at screenplays or films . They spent several years asking the right kinds of questions : If a character has a problem , why do n't they solve it ? and If someone does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about hiding it from themselves ? <p> Only then , after all the research and theory development into why stories exist , did they then measure their concepts up against films ( and novels and plays--story is story regardless of medium ) . Turns out what they discovered pans it : a complete story is an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem . <p> Yet despite all of the theories that exist in regards to Nostradamus , no one has been able to really apply them and predict an upcoming event. - Only in hindsight can they attempt to prove their point. - <p> The property I sold in 2009 to Dreamworks Animation was developed with Dramatica . Based on choices I made regarding Main Character Thematics and Story Dynamics it absolutely predicted the order in which I needed to approach my story . It even told me things about my story I did n't even know . " Save the Cat ! " and McKee do n't even come close to being able to do the same thing . Presenting them in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> So yes , Dramatica is good food for thought . But like every meal consumed , it provides the energy and nourishment necessary to excel and proliferate . Dramatica offers writers clear and demonstrable potential . <p> With Mercury in retrograde it 's no wonder so many people find difficulty maintaining their relationships1 ... of course , here we mean the relationship between the Main and Influence Character--that bit of a story Dramatica refers to as the Relationship Throughline : <p> The relationship throughline explores the conflicts inherent in the relationship . The relationship may be well established or new . It may be growing or falling apart . It may be there by mutual agreement , by unilateral choice , or imposed by outside forces . It may end in disaster or blossom into something new . The relationship is exciting in its possibilities . <p> Many writers new to the theory think this Relationship Throughline is an area where the two principal characters argue over the best way to solve the main story 's problem . Rookie move . Taking that approach collapses the breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitting a small intimate relationship against the greater conflict experienced by everyone . In other words , do n't do it . <p> In fact , you can write a Relationship Throughline where the two principals barely share any scene time together . In Pixar 's The Incredibles Bob the husband is the Main Character and his wife Helen is the Influence Character . Their relationship as husband and wife comes into conflict over Bob 's " cheating " activities . His going out and engaging in superhero antics creates a strain on their relationship and in their marriage . It is the stuff he is Doing ( their Relationship Throughline Concern ) , and the things they have agreed not to do , that is the source of the trouble in the relationship . <p> Many writers confuse the relationship throughline for the characters in it . Though the characters are party to the relationship , the RS is not about the characters as individuals . The RS is about the relationship . This means the RS Problem is about the source of conflict in the relationship . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship . The same is true for all other story points in the relationship throughline . Though you may choose to reveal the RS through your characters ' actions and words , the RS is always about the relationship . <p> The argument between Bob and Helen is n't about the best way to stop Syndrome , but it is thematically tied to it . It is n't an argument between one way of solving the main story 's problem and another way of solving it , but rather a clash of perspectives that by their nature ( opposing sides ) creates conflict in the space between them . That space is their relationship--their marriage--and it 's an essential component of the story . <p> The Relationship Throughline is not about two characters consistently making an argument over how to approach the big story problem . It 's not about the individuals or their individual takes on the relationship . The Relationship Throughline is about the relationship itself . The sooner Authors recognize the dramatic potential of this Throughline , the sooner we can reap the rewards of emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optical illusion that is a planet moving backwards has any effect whatsoever on anything . ? ? <p> During my writing time this morning my Main Character did something quite unexpected : she took control of my screenplay 2015-02 and moved it in a different direction . Usually this kind of abrupt change is met with anxiety and concern ; will this shift upset the tender balance of thematics I have so painstakingly constructed ? Or will it turn out to be the best decision for the story I am trying to write ? <p> Thankfully I have Dramatica on my side . As long as I can gently nudge this surprise move to somehow expose the thematics locked away in the Storyform every other scene has followed , the story should hold together . I can indulge these fantasies of my characters , allow them to grow in ways I never expected , and rest comfortably knowing the story will still make sense in the end . <p> The Storyform provides a thematic schematic of your story letting you know what will happen and in what order . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it possible for those happy accidents to occur without you losing sight of your story . <p> Many find themselves uncomfortable when faced with the task of unlearning what they have learned . Entrenched in their own beliefs and bias , they refuse to take the time to investigate closely new understandings of narrative . The result is often a sad and disappointing attempt at discounting what is undeniably a breakthrough advance . <p> So many mistakes , misunderstandings and half-truths concerning the Dramatica theory of story in this post from the Hatrack Writers Forum . The usual " I do n't like to be told what to do " defense masking for a failure to truly investigate the complex concepts of the theory . You know you 're in trouble when Aristotle 's Poetics is sighted as a superior text . <h> What Dramatica Sees <p> Dramatica is an incomplete model of the narrative form . The model makes the assumption problems can be and are meant to be solved . <p> This is half-true . Yes , one of the givens from Dramatica is the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind trying to solve a problem . Whether or not that problem is actually solved , however , is determined by the story 's dynamics . Some problems are solved ( as in Mad Max : Fury Road , Lord of the Flies and Romeo and Juliet ) , others are not ( Rain Man , To Kill a Mockingbird , and Hamlet ) . <p> That is but one narrative type ... other types ... include puzzle , revelation , the joke , and a non-story story type he labels " plotless , " though such stories are not plotless , only their structural features are experimental and unconventional , making them challenging to comprehend . <p> We could quibble over the meaning of plot , but yes--if your purpose in writing a story is to write something challenging to comprehend , then Dramatica theory is not for you . Dramatica helps writers communicate meaning to audience with clarity and purpose . Experimental narrative types , like those sampled in films like Terrence Malick 's The Tree of Life , are best left to other understandings of story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumes name spaces which are mere deviations , derivative , that is , of ancient labels and concepts . " Impact character , " for example , is derived from an older theory , unnamed , from " influence character . " <p> Not sure why this is a bad thing . New terminology needed to be created in order to more accurately describe the forces and points-of-view present in a complete story . As for the last bit , citing unnamed sources is a difficult tactic to counter . <p> An influence character influences a narrative 's action , positively or negatively , or both , and is not limited to personas , could be setting features and objects as well as events . <p> This is beginning to look like an argument of semantics--one of the prime reasons for Dramatica 's newly imagined and " rebranded " definitions . Old definitions are vague and deficient and require updating if any progress is to be made in our collective understanding of story . <p> An Influence Character , by Dramatica 's definition is that character , or more accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their personal problems . This point-of-view can not be held within a feature or object or even an event as one of its primary features is the ability to change over time ( Act by Act ) . The Influence Character 's point-of-view must be able to shift in order to better challenge the Main Character 's further avoidance of his or her own personal issues . <p> So no , the Influence Character of a story can not be a mountain , a lake or a rock . It needs to have a point-of-view . <p> It is apparent this person is confusing Antagonist for Influence Character . An Antagonist , by Dramatica 's clear definition , is an objective character role--a function--whose sole purpose is to prevent the Protagonist from achieving the Goal of the story . The Influence Character is a point-of-view whose purpose is to challenge the Main Character 's personal issues . Sometimes these two can be found in the same player ( as with the Joker in The Dark Knight ) but usually are found in separate players ( Ben Kenobi is the Influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Boo Radley is the Influence Character in To Kill a Mockingbird , Bob Ewell is the Antagonist ) . <p> Here you can see the reason for new terminology . Reading the original post one gets the idea that the contributor lacks focus in the concepts he or she presents . Definitions are all over the place and seemed to be jumbled up with competing contexts of narrative . This may explain the hostility towards Dramatica as the theory 's purpose is to bring clarity and greater understanding to narrative , not continue the confusion proffered for centuries . <h> The Difference between Objective and Subjective <p> Two other character types contained therein are objective and subjective characters . " Objective character " describes an observer persona , though " objective " is also a type of attitude : a shared unbiased value and belief perspective . " Subjective character " is an observed subject persona , though likewise is also a type of attitude : a personal , subject-to-bias value and belief perspective . <p> Here the author stamps his own erroneous interpretation onto Dramatica 's elegant concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protagonist of a story as Objective Characters . Objective because we stand back and look at them removed from the conflict ; we do n't assume their position . These two only represent a small fraction of the total amount of Objective Characters one may find in a story , yet they are the most important . The Antagonist and Protagonist represent the drive towards resolving and not resolving a story 's central problem . <p> The Subjective Characters differ from the Objective Characters because of their ability to grow and shift their point-of-view during a story . The Protagonist of a story will always pursue the Goal ; the Main Character may eventually change how they see the world . In Star Wars , Luke the Protagonist never ceased finding a way to fight the empire ; Luke the Main Character eventually learned to stop testing himself all the time and instead , trust in something outside of himself . This dichotomy helps provide the meaning of a story . <p> Also , objective , subjective , and influence characters are not per se fixed for those roles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more than one or could be all at the same time . <p> True , the point-of-view of the Influence Character may be handed off to different players as it is with the Ghosts in A Christmas Carol , but to think this appropriate for all story points sets an Author up for disaster . <p> This is where Dramatica shines as a powerful tool . By running counter to this popular notion that everything is everything and meaning constantly shifts , Dramatica helps a writer focus the intent of their story . Context creates meaning , if that meaning is constantly shifting then the end result is a meaningless mess . <p> Audiences crave a consistency of purpose . <h> Why the Old No Longer Works <p> The most ancient term for the functions of an influence or impact character is agonist , to mean a contestant that shapes the action such that the agency of a character or setting or event is transformatively influential . Antagonism is at least two forces in congruent opposition such that they are both unequivocally and irrevocably transformed by their direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of the Antagonist into the point-of-view of the Influence Character . This is why old outdated understandings of story serve only to confuse and destroy coherent and moving narrative . Modern precise terminology , like that found within Dramatica , grants greater clarity and sophistication of purpose . Mashing two clearly separate narrative concepts into one diminishes the power of both . <p> This same mistake happens when you find those convinced Protagonist and Main Character are one and the same . They often are , but they do n't always have to be . Andy is the Protagonist in The Shawshank Redemption ( the one trying to escape the system ) , but Red is the Main Character ( the institutionalized man whose point-of-view we assume ) . Furiosa is the Protagonist of Mad Max : Fury Road ( the one trying to run away ) , yet it is Max himself who we become personally involved with ( we know what goes on inside his head , we never find out what is going on inside hers ) . And finally , Atticus is the Protagonist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) while Scout is our way into the story . Atticus fights against prejudice while we as Scout do n't even realize we 're prejudice ourselves to the boogeyman across the street . <p> A clear understanding makes these kinds of sophisticated stories possible for everyone . <h> What ? <p> Dramatica Theory painfully subverts and misses entirely essential implication appeals -- the artfully implied intangible action of moral human condition struggles and crises , which is the more significant and appealing overall feature of a narrative : what a narrative is actually about . The tangible action is mere package for the moral human condition appeal and invariably superficial . <p> I confess I have no idea what any of this means , but it sounds like a vain attempt to discount Dramatica with nonsense . <p> Update : Chris Huntley , co-creator of Dramatica , offered this explanation after reading this article : <p> I think the part that you did n't quite understand is about the values espoused about a story 's subject matter -- the real world contextual meaning expressed through story encoding -- rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provides the author a means to evaluate the subject matter objectively and subjectively , linearly and holistically , in an effort to provide a meaningful narrative about the subject matter . <p> In other words , the author chooses that she wants to say about a subject matter , but she uses Dramatica to provide a comprehensive and understandable framework to argue the point using the narrative form . - For example , I may think that throwing battery acid on dogs is despicable , but Dramatica let 's me make a case for WHY it is despicable , and perhaps even points out contexts in which it may not be despicable in order to make the point better . <p> I have a tendency to assume that everyone is open enough to take the time to really understand what Dramatica is all about and what it offers to story . Thankfully , Chris has explained it enough times to people who do n't that he recognized what was being discussed here . Hope his update clears things up about what Dramatica is , and what it is n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insofar as it explains how narrative works . Dramatica clearly states that it is teaching the ingredients of story ; it 's up to the Author to combine them into a memorable and lasting meal . <p> A structure is the skeleton and is troublesome if exposed . The flesh , so to speak , is the meat of the matter and , though dramatic structure ( plot ) is pertinent and near universal of shape , is not a universal shape and can only fundamentally be defined as the moral human condition , which approaches infinite . They say beauty is only skin deep and ugly goes all the way to the bone ; artful narrative goes inside the bone , too , and naturally and appealingly , artfully , sublimely , beautifully drapes the skeletal structure . <p> This sounds wonderful . What the Author is describing is what Dramatica refers to as the second stage of narrative communication : Storytelling ( or Story Encoding ) . The first stage , or Storyforming process , is the stage the Dramatica Theory focuses on . The Storyform is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of thing any reasonable human being would want to sit through . As I tell everyone I have ever taught or consult with , you do n't get points for writing the perfect Dramatica story . The theory is there to help writers strengthen their communication skills and to effectively balance their story with a holistic understanding of the issues at hand . It 's not a form of narrative unto itself . <p> Finally , something we can agree on . <h> Common Ground <p> Dramatica Theory best practice may be appreciated as yet another emphasis on structure that accesses fundamentals , that asserts structure matters and is a part of a well-crafted narrative . The structure itself has n't changed since the first story ever told , only the names and principles and theories and values and beliefs have been variably enumerated over time , and are adaptive and adoptive to an era 's culture and technology , and even , yes , language sciences and arts . <p> And I agree with this as well , though I would say that Dramatica 's new terminology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevates it beyond anything that has come before . <p> Including Aristotle . <h> Only Good for Screenplays <p> Other writers chimed in : <p> a quick look at the Dramatica website , and the focus seems to be screenplays . <p> True , but that 's only because of the time required to analyze a film compared to the time necessary to accurately analyze a novel . We focus on film because that is where our passion lies . That does not discount the theory 's ability to better understand narrative in alternate forms . <p> Story is story regardless of medium and you can find coherent complete storyforms in plays as well as novels . The aforementioned To Kill a Mockingbird joins Lord of the Flies , Sula , Washington Square and Pride and Prejudice round out Dramatica 's collection of novel analyses . Romeo and Juliet , Hamlet , Othello and Ibsen 's A Doll 's House offer a collection of play analyses . <p> One clarification which should make this easier to understand : a work can have more than one Storyform . Like the Sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord of the Rings contains many many different storyforms : Frodo and Samwise , Frodo and Gollum , Aragorn and Arwen and so on . Anytime you find two characters with competing points of view that grow over time and challenge each other , you will find a new Storyform . Most films only have time to explore one Storyform , the novel affords a great many more . Though you 'll note that the truly great novels only focus on one ( Mockingbird and All The Light We Can not See working as two wonderful examples ) . <h> More than Spin <p> Well , I clicked on the link , started reading the blurb about how much of a paradigm shift Dramatica is and promptly closed the page . To me it appears as a classic case of what the boffins and spin-meisters call re-branding . Let 's use all the same literary constructs but update them so they 're hip and sound flash , right Dude ? I 'd rather study Aristotle , Freytag , and Egri , just to name a couple . <p> While Egri identified the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important aspect of them : that one changes their resolve while the other remains steadfast . The resolve of both principal characters is essential towards providing the meaning of the story to the Audience . <p> Dramatica is more than rebranding , more than name deviation . It is a comprehensive understanding of story without caveat and without exception . Its foundation of the Four Throughlines found in every complete story and its assertion that not every Protagonist is a Main Character clearly delineates it from everything that came before . Take the time to truly understand what it is saying before you discount it ; you might find something worthy of applying to your own work . <p> That 's how creative life works . No secret tricks you just do n't know yet . No hacks that save you so much time that clocks run in reverse in your presence . It sounds about as sexy as golf pants because it 's just lots of work . <p> Many think Dramatica is a cheat , a way to quickly hack together a formula-driven Hollywood screenplay . Dramatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still actually have to sit down and write the whole thing . <p> We just need to do the work that 's in us to do . We just need to keep making what we 're making . To not wait for someone else to tell us it 's ok , or good enough , or launchable , or valid . Yes , it could fail or only be a moderate success , but that 's outside of our control any way . <p> Sound advice for anyone working in a creative field , particularly writing . No use waiting around for that validation you have no control over . <p> Been far too long since I 've worked on 2015-02--at least a week . Work responsibilities and preparation for last weekend 's Dramatica Guided Tour Workshop drained me of all my writing time and energy . <p> As I recall I was finishing up the Main Character 's Third Signpost and was about to wrap it all up with the Fourth .

Imagine trying to drag the MC Domain of a Do-er down into Fixed Attitude or Manipulation only to have it snap back into place in Situation or Activity ... Or dragging and dropping characters into the Build Characters window ... Or being able to rotate around the model in 3D ... Ugh , if only there was an extra me I would do it in a second ! <p> Mike Wollaeger , Dramatica Story Expert and all-around nice guy , had some excellent advice for writers new to Dramatica : <p> The first time I used Dramatica to storyform a screenplay I was writing , I misunderstood about 90% of everything I was doing . Repetition and throwing yourself headfirst into testing out your understanding ( and dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move forward . <p> This is the same experience I had . I did n't understand how a story could be about anything else but Obtaining . Of course every story is about achieving something , what else could it be ? Subsequently , I 've discovered the difference between the energy to resolve a goal and the actual type of Goal , but absolutely , you have to go into Dramatica knowing you 're not going to get it the first couple of years . <p> It 's been almost 20 years for me and I 'm just now understanding the Relationship Throughline . Your mileage may vary . <p> If I could do it again , I would do the impossible , which is focus on fewer things in the theory until I had them down cold . I would be sure to be able to cleave apart the MC and the Protagonist . Even if , especially if , they are played by the same person . I would aim to distinguish Do-ers from Be-ers . I would try to break stories down into their Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I could determine Success &amp; Failure . <p> This is a fantastic list and really should be the only things newbies see when they first dive into Dramatica . Learn these and then move on to the more complicated stuff . <p> The tricky part here is that it 's hard to know if you 've done it right if this is all you focus on . If you try to carry a story all the way to the bottom , then the model starts to fight back if you 've got something wrong . At the high levels , there is no feedback yet . <p> Perfect advice . Not sure why I did n't see this before but you can be sure I will take this approach with new writers in the future . <p> He left the best advice for last : <p> Also , bear in mind that Dramatica will help your story , but it will not help you write . So keep writing , daily , while you learn Dramatica . <p> He David Fincher , along with Mike De Luca and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save that ending , and they are the reason that that ending was maintained and is the ending that 's in the movie . Without them , no one was going to listen to me , the lowly screenwriter " that 's just the way it goes . <p> Because who would know better whether or not an ending works well thematically with everything that came before it then the guy who has spent the past couple of years going over it with a fine tooth comb . <p> The ending of Se7en had to be what it was because everything prior led up to that moment . Pity 's character was a hot head and it was Morgan 's character who constantly kept him in check . It was only once Morgan finally had his moment of impulsiveness ( the slapping of John Doe ) that Pitt 's character was finally allowed off his chain . Those moments meant something . As despicable as Doe 's actions were , they were n't a threat as long as more level-headed men were around . <p> Once that departed , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains shining example of why it is important to have a purposeful complete narrative first . And why it is important to fight every step of the way for that story . <p> Phenomenal storytelling under the stars at the annual Dreamworks Animation TV Movie Under the Stars event . This year 's film was The Iron Giant ( non-director 's cut ) , a great reminder that complete storytelling endures . <p> Produced screenwriter and former Sony Studios story analyst Ken Miyamoto has this to say about Dramatica in a Quora answer : <p> Film Theorists have one thing going for them ... hindsight. - They can look at a film or screenplay and pretty much dissect it any way they 'd like , in order to fit it in whatever formula or directive they are preaching. - <p> Ken is way off track here . Chris and Melanie developed Dramatica without looking at screenplays or films . They spent several years asking the right kinds of questions : If a character has a problem , why do n't they solve it ? and If someone does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about hiding it from themselves ? <p> Only then , after all the research and theory development into why stories exist , did they then measure their concepts up against films ( and novels and plays--story is story regardless of medium ) . Turns out what they discovered pans it : a complete story is an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem . <p> Yet despite all of the theories that exist in regards to Nostradamus , no one has been able to really apply them and predict an upcoming event. - Only in hindsight can they attempt to prove their point. - <p> The property I sold in 2009 to Dreamworks Animation was developed with Dramatica . Based on choices I made regarding Main Character Thematics and Story Dynamics it absolutely predicted the order in which I needed to approach my story . It even told me things about my story I did n't even know . " Save the Cat ! " and McKee do n't even come close to being able to do the same thing . Presenting them in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> So yes , Dramatica is good food for thought . But like every meal consumed , it provides the energy and nourishment necessary to excel and proliferate . Dramatica offers writers clear and demonstrable potential . <p> With Mercury in retrograde it 's no wonder so many people find difficulty maintaining their relationships1 ... of course , here we mean the relationship between the Main and Influence Character--that bit of a story Dramatica refers to as the Relationship Throughline : <p> The relationship throughline explores the conflicts inherent in the relationship . The relationship may be well established or new . It may be growing or falling apart . It may be there by mutual agreement , by unilateral choice , or imposed by outside forces . It may end in disaster or blossom into something new . The relationship is exciting in its possibilities . <p> Many writers new to the theory think this Relationship Throughline is an area where the two principal characters argue over the best way to solve the main story 's problem . Rookie move . Taking that approach collapses the breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitting a small intimate relationship against the greater conflict experienced by everyone . In other words , do n't do it . <p> In fact , you can write a Relationship Throughline where the two principals barely share any scene time together . In Pixar 's The Incredibles Bob the husband is the Main Character and his wife Helen is the Influence Character . Their relationship as husband and wife comes into conflict over Bob 's " cheating " activities . His going out and engaging in superhero antics creates a strain on their relationship and in their marriage . It is the stuff he is Doing ( their Relationship Throughline Concern ) , and the things they have agreed not to do , that is the source of the trouble in the relationship . <p> Many writers confuse the relationship throughline for the characters in it . Though the characters are party to the relationship , the RS is not about the characters as individuals . The RS is about the relationship . This means the RS Problem is about the source of conflict in the relationship . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship . The same is true for all other story points in the relationship throughline . Though you may choose to reveal the RS through your characters ' actions and words , the RS is always about the relationship . <p> The argument between Bob and Helen is n't about the best way to stop Syndrome , but it is thematically tied to it . It is n't an argument between one way of solving the main story 's problem and another way of solving it , but rather a clash of perspectives that by their nature ( opposing sides ) creates conflict in the space between them . That space is their relationship--their marriage--and it 's an essential component of the story . <p> The Relationship Throughline is not about two characters consistently making an argument over how to approach the big story problem . It 's not about the individuals or their individual takes on the relationship . The Relationship Throughline is about the relationship itself . The sooner Authors recognize the dramatic potential of this Throughline , the sooner we can reap the rewards of emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optical illusion that is a planet moving backwards has any effect whatsoever on anything . ? ? <p> During my writing time this morning my Main Character did something quite unexpected : she took control of my screenplay 2015-02 and moved it in a different direction . Usually this kind of abrupt change is met with anxiety and concern ; will this shift upset the tender balance of thematics I have so painstakingly constructed ? Or will it turn out to be the best decision for the story I am trying to write ? <p> Thankfully I have Dramatica on my side . As long as I can gently nudge this surprise move to somehow expose the thematics locked away in the Storyform every other scene has followed , the story should hold together . I can indulge these fantasies of my characters , allow them to grow in ways I never expected , and rest comfortably knowing the story will still make sense in the end . <p> The Storyform provides a thematic schematic of your story letting you know what will happen and in what order . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it possible for those happy accidents to occur without you losing sight of your story . <p> Many find themselves uncomfortable when faced with the task of unlearning what they have learned . Entrenched in their own beliefs and bias , they refuse to take the time to investigate closely new understandings of narrative . The result is often a sad and disappointing attempt at discounting what is undeniably a breakthrough advance . <p> So many mistakes , misunderstandings and half-truths concerning the Dramatica theory of story in this post from the Hatrack Writers Forum . The usual " I do n't like to be told what to do " defense masking for a failure to truly investigate the complex concepts of the theory . You know you 're in trouble when Aristotle 's Poetics is sighted as a superior text . <h> What Dramatica Sees <p> Dramatica is an incomplete model of the narrative form . The model makes the assumption problems can be and are meant to be solved . <p> This is half-true . Yes , one of the givens from Dramatica is the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind trying to solve a problem . Whether or not that problem is actually solved , however , is determined by the story 's dynamics . Some problems are solved ( as in Mad Max : Fury Road , Lord of the Flies and Romeo and Juliet ) , others are not ( Rain Man , To Kill a Mockingbird , and Hamlet ) . <p> That is but one narrative type ... other types ... include puzzle , revelation , the joke , and a non-story story type he labels " plotless , " though such stories are not plotless , only their structural features are experimental and unconventional , making them challenging to comprehend . <p> We could quibble over the meaning of plot , but yes--if your purpose in writing a story is to write something challenging to comprehend , then Dramatica theory is not for you . Dramatica helps writers communicate meaning to audience with clarity and purpose . Experimental narrative types , like those sampled in films like Terrence Malick 's The Tree of Life , are best left to other understandings of story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumes name spaces which are mere deviations , derivative , that is , of ancient labels and concepts . " Impact character , " for example , is derived from an older theory , unnamed , from " influence character . " <p> Not sure why this is a bad thing . New terminology needed to be created in order to more accurately describe the forces and points-of-view present in a complete story . As for the last bit , citing unnamed sources is a difficult tactic to counter . <p> An influence character influences a narrative 's action , positively or negatively , or both , and is not limited to personas , could be setting features and objects as well as events . <p> This is beginning to look like an argument of semantics--one of the prime reasons for Dramatica 's newly imagined and " rebranded " definitions . Old definitions are vague and deficient and require updating if any progress is to be made in our collective understanding of story . <p> An Influence Character , by Dramatica 's definition is that character , or more accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their personal problems . This point-of-view can not be held within a feature or object or even an event as one of its primary features is the ability to change over time ( Act by Act ) . The Influence Character 's point-of-view must be able to shift in order to better challenge the Main Character 's further avoidance of his or her own personal issues . <p> So no , the Influence Character of a story can not be a mountain , a lake or a rock . It needs to have a point-of-view . <p> It is apparent this person is confusing Antagonist for Influence Character . An Antagonist , by Dramatica 's clear definition , is an objective character role--a function--whose sole purpose is to prevent the Protagonist from achieving the Goal of the story . The Influence Character is a point-of-view whose purpose is to challenge the Main Character 's personal issues . Sometimes these two can be found in the same player ( as with the Joker in The Dark Knight ) but usually are found in separate players ( Ben Kenobi is the Influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Boo Radley is the Influence Character in To Kill a Mockingbird , Bob Ewell is the Antagonist ) . <p> Here you can see the reason for new terminology . Reading the original post one gets the idea that the contributor lacks focus in the concepts he or she presents . Definitions are all over the place and seemed to be jumbled up with competing contexts of narrative . This may explain the hostility towards Dramatica as the theory 's purpose is to bring clarity and greater understanding to narrative , not continue the confusion proffered for centuries . <h> The Difference between Objective and Subjective <p> Two other character types contained therein are objective and subjective characters . " Objective character " describes an observer persona , though " objective " is also a type of attitude : a shared unbiased value and belief perspective . " Subjective character " is an observed subject persona , though likewise is also a type of attitude : a personal , subject-to-bias value and belief perspective . <p> Here the author stamps his own erroneous interpretation onto Dramatica 's elegant concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protagonist of a story as Objective Characters . Objective because we stand back and look at them removed from the conflict ; we do n't assume their position . These two only represent a small fraction of the total amount of Objective Characters one may find in a story , yet they are the most important . The Antagonist and Protagonist represent the drive towards resolving and not resolving a story 's central problem . <p> The Subjective Characters differ from the Objective Characters because of their ability to grow and shift their point-of-view during a story . The Protagonist of a story will always pursue the Goal ; the Main Character may eventually change how they see the world . In Star Wars , Luke the Protagonist never ceased finding a way to fight the empire ; Luke the Main Character eventually learned to stop testing himself all the time and instead , trust in something outside of himself . This dichotomy helps provide the meaning of a story . <p> Also , objective , subjective , and influence characters are not per se fixed for those roles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more than one or could be all at the same time . <p> True , the point-of-view of the Influence Character may be handed off to different players as it is with the Ghosts in A Christmas Carol , but to think this appropriate for all story points sets an Author up for disaster . <p> This is where Dramatica shines as a powerful tool . By running counter to this popular notion that everything is everything and meaning constantly shifts , Dramatica helps a writer focus the intent of their story . Context creates meaning , if that meaning is constantly shifting then the end result is a meaningless mess . <p> Audiences crave a consistency of purpose . <h> Why the Old No Longer Works <p> The most ancient term for the functions of an influence or impact character is agonist , to mean a contestant that shapes the action such that the agency of a character or setting or event is transformatively influential . Antagonism is at least two forces in congruent opposition such that they are both unequivocally and irrevocably transformed by their direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of the Antagonist into the point-of-view of the Influence Character . This is why old outdated understandings of story serve only to confuse and destroy coherent and moving narrative . Modern precise terminology , like that found within Dramatica , grants greater clarity and sophistication of purpose . Mashing two clearly separate narrative concepts into one diminishes the power of both . <p> This same mistake happens when you find those convinced Protagonist and Main Character are one and the same . They often are , but they do n't always have to be . Andy is the Protagonist in The Shawshank Redemption ( the one trying to escape the system ) , but Red is the Main Character ( the institutionalized man whose point-of-view we assume ) . Furiosa is the Protagonist of Mad Max : Fury Road ( the one trying to run away ) , yet it is Max himself who we become personally involved with ( we know what goes on inside his head , we never find out what is going on inside hers ) . And finally , Atticus is the Protagonist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) while Scout is our way into the story . Atticus fights against prejudice while we as Scout do n't even realize we 're prejudice ourselves to the boogeyman across the street . <p> A clear understanding makes these kinds of sophisticated stories possible for everyone . <h> What ? <p> Dramatica Theory painfully subverts and misses entirely essential implication appeals -- the artfully implied intangible action of moral human condition struggles and crises , which is the more significant and appealing overall feature of a narrative : what a narrative is actually about . The tangible action is mere package for the moral human condition appeal and invariably superficial . <p> I confess I have no idea what any of this means , but it sounds like a vain attempt to discount Dramatica with nonsense . <p> Update : Chris Huntley , co-creator of Dramatica , offered this explanation after reading this article : <p> I think the part that you did n't quite understand is about the values espoused about a story 's subject matter -- the real world contextual meaning expressed through story encoding -- rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provides the author a means to evaluate the subject matter objectively and subjectively , linearly and holistically , in an effort to provide a meaningful narrative about the subject matter . <p> In other words , the author chooses that she wants to say about a subject matter , but she uses Dramatica to provide a comprehensive and understandable framework to argue the point using the narrative form . - For example , I may think that throwing battery acid on dogs is despicable , but Dramatica let 's me make a case for WHY it is despicable , and perhaps even points out contexts in which it may not be despicable in order to make the point better . <p> I have a tendency to assume that everyone is open enough to take the time to really understand what Dramatica is all about and what it offers to story . Thankfully , Chris has explained it enough times to people who do n't that he recognized what was being discussed here . Hope his update clears things up about what Dramatica is , and what it is n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insofar as it explains how narrative works . Dramatica clearly states that it is teaching the ingredients of story ; it 's up to the Author to combine them into a memorable and lasting meal . <p> A structure is the skeleton and is troublesome if exposed . The flesh , so to speak , is the meat of the matter and , though dramatic structure ( plot ) is pertinent and near universal of shape , is not a universal shape and can only fundamentally be defined as the moral human condition , which approaches infinite . They say beauty is only skin deep and ugly goes all the way to the bone ; artful narrative goes inside the bone , too , and naturally and appealingly , artfully , sublimely , beautifully drapes the skeletal structure . <p> This sounds wonderful . What the Author is describing is what Dramatica refers to as the second stage of narrative communication : Storytelling ( or Story Encoding ) . The first stage , or Storyforming process , is the stage the Dramatica Theory focuses on . The Storyform is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of thing any reasonable human being would want to sit through . As I tell everyone I have ever taught or consult with , you do n't get points for writing the perfect Dramatica story . The theory is there to help writers strengthen their communication skills and to effectively balance their story with a holistic understanding of the issues at hand . It 's not a form of narrative unto itself . <p> Finally , something we can agree on . <h> Common Ground <p> Dramatica Theory best practice may be appreciated as yet another emphasis on structure that accesses fundamentals , that asserts structure matters and is a part of a well-crafted narrative . The structure itself has n't changed since the first story ever told , only the names and principles and theories and values and beliefs have been variably enumerated over time , and are adaptive and adoptive to an era 's culture and technology , and even , yes , language sciences and arts . <p> And I agree with this as well , though I would say that Dramatica 's new terminology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevates it beyond anything that has come before . <p> Including Aristotle . <h> Only Good for Screenplays <p> Other writers chimed in : <p> a quick look at the Dramatica website , and the focus seems to be screenplays . <p> True , but that 's only because of the time required to analyze a film compared to the time necessary to accurately analyze a novel . We focus on film because that is where our passion lies . That does not discount the theory 's ability to better understand narrative in alternate forms . <p> Story is story regardless of medium and you can find coherent complete storyforms in plays as well as novels . The aforementioned To Kill a Mockingbird joins Lord of the Flies , Sula , Washington Square and Pride and Prejudice round out Dramatica 's collection of novel analyses . Romeo and Juliet , Hamlet , Othello and Ibsen 's A Doll 's House offer a collection of play analyses . <p> One clarification which should make this easier to understand : a work can have more than one Storyform . Like the Sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord of the Rings contains many many different storyforms : Frodo and Samwise , Frodo and Gollum , Aragorn and Arwen and so on . Anytime you find two characters with competing points of view that grow over time and challenge each other , you will find a new Storyform . Most films only have time to explore one Storyform , the novel affords a great many more . Though you 'll note that the truly great novels only focus on one ( Mockingbird and All The Light We Can not See working as two wonderful examples ) . <h> More than Spin <p> Well , I clicked on the link , started reading the blurb about how much of a paradigm shift Dramatica is and promptly closed the page . To me it appears as a classic case of what the boffins and spin-meisters call re-branding . Let 's use all the same literary constructs but update them so they 're hip and sound flash , right Dude ? I 'd rather study Aristotle , Freytag , and Egri , just to name a couple . <p> While Egri identified the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important aspect of them : that one changes their resolve while the other remains steadfast . The resolve of both principal characters is essential towards providing the meaning of the story to the Audience . <p> Dramatica is more than rebranding , more than name deviation . It is a comprehensive understanding of story without caveat and without exception . Its foundation of the Four Throughlines found in every complete story and its assertion that not every Protagonist is a Main Character clearly delineates it from everything that came before . Take the time to truly understand what it is saying before you discount it ; you might find something worthy of applying to your own work . <p> That 's how creative life works . No secret tricks you just do n't know yet . No hacks that save you so much time that clocks run in reverse in your presence . It sounds about as sexy as golf pants because it 's just lots of work . <p> Many think Dramatica is a cheat , a way to quickly hack together a formula-driven Hollywood screenplay . Dramatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still actually have to sit down and write the whole thing . <p> We just need to do the work that 's in us to do . We just need to keep making what we 're making . To not wait for someone else to tell us it 's ok , or good enough , or launchable , or valid . Yes , it could fail or only be a moderate success , but that 's outside of our control any way . <p> Sound advice for anyone working in a creative field , particularly writing . No use waiting around for that validation you have no control over . <p> Been far too long since I 've worked on 2015-02--at least a week . Work responsibilities and preparation for last weekend 's Dramatica Guided Tour Workshop drained me of all my writing time and energy . <p> As I recall I was finishing up the Main Character 's Third Signpost and was about to wrap it all up with the Fourth .

Instinctively , authors search for a better understanding of this connection yet find trouble when they look in the wrong place . <p> I recently received this question in regards to the relationship between the Main Character and Influence Character Problems : <p> I was wondering if you might elucidate the relationship between the MC characters problem/solution and the IC characters problem/solution . When the MC is a change character it means they 're changing their approach from the MC problem to the MC solution . But since the ICs role in the story is to challenge the MCs approach , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " problem " ) come into the MCs change . <p> Its interesting because I have always wondered this myself . I know there is no direct connection between Problem elements because these are , after all , not Dynamic Pairs . In Dramatica , Dynamic Pairs are everythingand the bias of the model itself . <p> But the writer inside intuits that there must be something more there . If this character is driven by this motivation and the one responsible for her or his paradigm shift is motivated by another motivation , it only makes sense that there should be some connection between them . Right ? <p> And then you realize that it is the lack of direct connection at this level that makes the whole Dramatica model possible . <h> A Method for Determining Problems <p> When Chris and Melanie developed Dramatica they were looking for a way of understanding where problems exist and where to find solutions to those problems . They determined thatas humans with minds built to solve problemswe could see a problem existing either outside of ourselves or within ourselves . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a process . External and internal states can be seen in Situations and Fixed Attitudes respectively . External and internal processes can be seen in Activities and Manners of Thinking respectively . <p> This bias or baseline setup by Chris and Melanie is Dramatica . The dynamic pairing between **31;327;TOOLONG defines the labels found within the Dramatica Table of Story Elements . It reflects the difference between particles and waves ( states and process ) , linear and holistic problem-solving , and even the difference between a noun and a verb found in the English language . The dynamic pairing is the meaning of the structure . <p> Dramatica is a model of narrative that looks to stories as analogies of a single human mind trying to resolve an inequity . With that in mind you can see how this idea of dynamic pairs is essential to how Dramatica works . It also clues you in on how certain elements of structure are tied togetherlike the Main and Influence Character . <h> Structural Connections <p> As Dynamic Pairs , the Main Character and Influence Character Throughlines connect at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class or Genre level , the MC and IC Throughlines are connected by the dynamic pairing of their Domains . A Situation Main Character will find an Influence Character in Fixed Attitude . Joy in Inside Out is former captain of a ship she no longer controls herself and Sadness as her Influence Character is , well , eternally sad . A Manner of Thinking Main Character will find an Influence Character in Activity . Think of Main Character Stingo ( Peter MacNicol ) in Sophies Choice and his Influence Character of Sophie ( Meryl Streep ) . Stingo is coming of age and maturing psychologically , while Sophie is the kind of character who rearranges chairs so she does n't  have to deal with her own issues . <p> At the Type or plot level , one will find the Main and Influence Characters connected by their shared type of Concerns . A Main Character with a Concern of Memories will be paired with an Influence Character concerned with the Past . Leonard Shelby ( Guy Pearce ) in Memento suffers from short-term memory loss and his Influence Character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire history of everything . A Main Character concerned with Innermost Desires will be paired with an Influence Character tied to the Future . In Moulin Rouge ! Christian ( Ewan McGregor ) believes all you need is love , yet is paired with Satine ( Nicole Kidman ) who cares only for a comfortable and well-established future . <p> At the Variation or theme level , the Main Character and Influence Character will find resonance in the variations of the themes they explore . A Main Character saddled with Issues of Destiny will find themselves up against an Influence Character ensconced by Falsehoods . Think Dominick Cobb ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) in Inception and his issues with that train that is always coming and match that up against his wife Mals unwavering belief in something that was a lie . A Main Character struggling with Issues of Circumstances will naturally find themselves matching wits with an Influence Character bogged down by Interpretation . Ray Kinsella ( Kevin Costner ) in Field of Dreams struggles to mature in this coming-of-age drama because of the circumstances surrounding his tenuous relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrence Mann ( James Earl Jones ) who offers not only an interpretation of Rays wild and violent behavior , but also an explanation as to what this field really means for the people who encounter it . <p> It is only when we reach the bottom of the model that the differential between connection and influence begins to arise . <h> Direct Connections and Forces of Influence <p> When we get down to the Element , or character level , the Problem , Solution , Symptom , and Response of the Main Character and Influence Character Throughlines cease to be dynamic pairs . If they were the entire model would break down as both Main and Influence Character would be looking at separate things . Instead , these two Throughlines find a force of influence that motivates and inspires growth . <p> Next weeks article will cover this influence and offer a greater understanding of the various connections and influence that go on between these two Throughlines . For now , it is enough to appreciate the intimate qualities that these two characters share . They are not random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jar the Main Character out of their own inert belief systems . Dramatica simply offers a language for understanding and interpreting the connection between these two perspectives .

Any time you have a horizontal relationship between the two , you will find that the Main Character needs to Stop , or grow out of something . The reasons for this would require greater exploration , but for now it is enough to understand that the placement of the Throughlines and the issues they explore play a significant role in determining the growth and development of a character within a story .

@@119273340 @8273340/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Our Analysis Of Kramer vs . Kramer <h> While simple and sublime in its choice of thematic material , *Kramer vs . Kramer* reveals some key insights into how great stories work . <p> At the monthly Dramatica Users Group meeting last night , we watched the Academy Award winning Kramer vs . Kramer , starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep . To say that I loved the film is an understatement . I miss acting . To say I was underwhelmed by the storyform we discovered is also an understatement . <p> There is an area of narrative within the Dramatica Table of Story Elements that bores the heck out of me . Predominantly seen in films from the mid-20th century , this storyform features an Overall Story Concern or Goal of Obtaining , and a Main Character Concern of the Future . <p> Snoozerific . <p> This genre of storytelling has been done so many times that I ca n't help but groan and complain when it ends up in there . For some reason it feels so pedestrian to me and unsophisticated . Narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reconsidering , or Logic and Feeling . Ugh . Even typing that out bores me to tears . <p> Thats whyif you listen to the podcast analysis or watch our online analysis of Kramer vs . Krameryou hear me try and argue for a different storyform . I loved the film and wanted it to be anywhere else but there in the chart . At that point confirmation bias takes over and I lose all sight of what is really going on . Eventually I saw the light , but you can hear me fight it every step of the way . <p> This is always been a problem for me . Ever since Dramatica opened up my mind to the subtleties and sophistication in narrative , I try and gear stories towards that sophistication . But this is the end of the 1970s ; Kramer vs . Kramer is a product of that time period . The film maintains an innocence and no pain-lotta gain personality that permeates film during that century . And what 's moreit really should n't matter . <p> A story is a story no matter where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that once and for all . I cant let my own prejudices or subjective interpretations get in the way of an accurate analysis . Dramatica is objective after allno time for lame opinions . I cant remember the last film with an Overall Story Problem of Consider so if nothing else , Kramer offers up a great example of what a story with that problem would feel like . <p> Ted ( Dustin Hoffman ) is an inconsiderate man and grows to a point where he can reconsider his effect on other people and on the child he really never thought about before . That is a valid storyform and an important facet of problem-solving to cover . <p> Other notable notes from last night analysis : <p> Joanna is not a good candidate for the Influence Character as the relationship between her and Ted exists in the Overall Story . That relationship about being Exs is the whole Kramer vs . Kramer part . You want the Relationship Story Throughline and the Relationship it focuses on to be something separate from the OS . <p> Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning is because the 2nd Story Driverthe one that comes between the 1st and 2nd Signpostis only lightly painted . The Decision not to hang out with the boss after the party implies a decision to put Billy before work . Nothing much is made of it . Compound that with a slide from Signpost 1 to Signpost 2 ( Doing to Obtaining ) and it feels like a very long first Act . <p> When it comes to the Main Character Growth , you look to what it took to get to the point where a character could change their resolvenot how their resolve changes . With Kramer vs . Kramer it can seem like Ted had to step-up and Start taking care of his son , but that does n't  speak to his problem . Teds problem was that he was his own worst enemy and he needed to stop focusing on how he was the one always " bringing home the bacon " . His life was going great , and then world came and dumped on him and now he had to pick up the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes more sense to think of him as a character with a chip on his shoulder , rather than a hole in his heart which is what a Stop character feels like . <p> The most important revelation last night is something that I 'm going to develop into my article for this week . In the analysis Chris mentions that until Ted can let that Concern of the Future go , he will still be stuck with his personal issues . Might not seem like much right now , but I ca n't stress how important Chriss line of thinking is towards understanding story through Dramatica . Be on the lookout for that article this week . <p> And then finally , the last notable-notable , was discussion surround the Changed/Steadfast nature of the Relationship Story Throughlinesomething that is rarely discussed anywhere within Dramatica . And something else I will write an article about in the near future . <p> In short , if the Relationship is a positive Steadfast oneone that is growingthen you will see the bulk of the conflict within the Symptom and Response of that Throughline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments over Logic and Feeling ( " Why ? Because I said so . Why ? Because I said so . Why ? " followed by an outburst of emotion ) . <p> Contrast this with a Changed Dynamic relationship where the Relationship Story Throughline is the one thing that would resolve the drive in their relationshipif they were trying to make things more difficult for one another . This is n't what is happening between Ted and Billy in Kramer vs . Kramer.

@@119273377 @8273377/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Of Tragedies and Triumphs <p> There are tragic endings , and there are triumphant ones . There are celebrations of personal achievements , and cautionary tales of pushing too far . The meaningful ending is the purpose of a story , it is the essence of what the author is trying to say . <p> Understanding the mechanics of what makes a story a tragedy or a triumph can go a long way towards insuring that every audience member ends their experience both satisfied and emotionally fulfilled . <h> A Theoretical Basis for Understanding <p> In this series on Meaningful Endings , I 've set out to examine exactly what is going on with well-told stories . While the two core questions asked ( Did the good guys win , Does the main character go home happy or sad ) may seem overly simplistic , they are actually based on a very sophisticated theory of story known as Dramatica . If you 're a regular reader of this site or know me at all , you know that I consider this theory the be-all end-all of story theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily inspired by what Ive learned from studying it . In other words , I think its super-cool . <p> Happy Ending - The protagonist achieves the " outer " and " inner " goal . In other words , the hero gets the gold and becomes a better person . <p> Bittersweet - The protagonist achieves the " inner " goal , but fails to get the " outer " goal . In Rain Man , Charlie does n't  get " ownership " of his brother , but he does grow from a self-centered narcissist to a more selfless brother . <p> Cautionary Tale - The protagonist gets the " outer " goal , but fails to achieve the " inner " transformation . In Citizen Kane , Charles Foster gets the power and wealth ( outer ) , but dies empty and unfulfilled ( " Rosebud " represented the innocence and joy of his childhood ) . <p> Tragic - The protagonist achieves neither the " inner " nor the " outer " goal , Leaving Las Vegas was , in my opinion , a tragedy ( although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " drink himself to death " which he did accomplish ) . <p> Sound familiar ? ! <p> Now whether or not Rydall was influenced or aware of Dramatica is not fully clear as it is n't mentioned anywhere in his book ( I suspect it is as there are more than a couple instances where the theory shines through ) . Either way , its a fantastic read , especially if you have any interest in becoming a story analyst . I bring it up only to show that this concept of connecting the results of the main story line with the results from the personal story line is a sound technique for analyzing what a story is trying to say . <p> Two questions : Did the good guys win or lose ? and Did the main character go home happy or sad ? The sum of which adds up to a purposeful ending . <h> The Good Guys Win or Lose <p> When you talk about this half of the equation , what you are really focusing on is the Objective Story Throughline . Typically referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " story ) , the Objective Story Throughline is that part of the story that involves everyone . It is labeled Objective because it is looking at the storys central problem from an objectified 3rd person point-of-view . Characters do n't  have names when taking this perspective , they have roles . So Mav in Top Gun becomes the " Hot Shot Fighter Pilot " , Marge in Fargo becomes the " Plunky Sheriff " , and Miranda in The Devil Wears Prada becomes the " Evil Magazine Editor " ( of course there are other names you could call her , but let 's keep it clean ! ) . <p> Its a good trick because when you stop using characters real names , you tend to focus less on their own personal issues and more on how they function in the story . This is the part of the story where Protagonists , Antagonists , Sidekicks and Guardians reside . Again , function over the personal . <p> So when you ask the question , " Did the good guys win or lose ? " you are in essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up in success or failure ? " The Protagonist , nine times out of ten , is someone the audience would interpret as the " good guy " and it is this interpretation that they use as a baseline when they want to know the logistical meaning behind a storys conclusion . <p> The Dramatica theory of story labels the answer to this question the Story Outcome . Was it a Success ( good guys win ) or was it a Failure ( good guys lose ) ? <h> The Main Character Goes Home <p> On the other side of the meaningful endings equation lies the Main Character . When asking whether they go home happy or sad , what you are really trying to establish is whether or not the Main Character resolves their own personal problems . These internal issues are the sole property of the Main Character ; other characters may comment on it or be a part of it , but the heart of that emotional turmoil belongs to the Main Character . So Stan has his Wendy-induced anxiety , Detective Somerset wants to retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story these Main Characters inhabit serves as an opportunity for personal growth . <p> So when you ask the question , " Did the Main Character go home happy or sad ? " what you are really asking is " Did the Main Character resolve their own personal angst ? " The audience uses the answer to this question as a baseline for determining the emotional meaning behind a storys conclusion . <p> Dramatica labels the answer to this question the Story Judgment ; Judgment because it is the Authors evaluation of the Main Characters efforts to work through his or her issues . Was it Good ( main character goes home happy ) or was it Bad ( main character goes home sad ) ? <h> A Purpose to Storytelling <p> Choosing the answers to these two questions locks in the meaning of a story . A storyteller can only hope for confusion if he or she does not fully appreciate the concept between these two story structures . Audiences reach to stories for an explanation of why things are the way they are . Sure , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sadly , perhaps , even a thoughtless desire for distraction . But overwhelmed by the crushing flood of information and bite-sized video clips available from monitors and phones everywhere , audience members will quickly comment on anything less than purposeful as " Meh . " They want more . <p> Giving them a meaningful ending overcomes all that noise . <p> A story provides the audience a welcome respite from the meaningless and a chance to ponder why .

The story ends when the warden kills himself . <p> A Situation Overall Story calls for a problematic situation ; something is stuck and it needs to be unstuck . Remove the warden ( and ostensibly the Captain of the Guards ) and you remove the conflict . That describes the External Situation everyone in the story is dealing with .

Using a single film as a common point of reference for these topics ( in this case Nightcrawler ) works wonderfully and I 'm glad I made that change earlier this year . <p> Looking forward to getting into more of the Dramatica nitty-gritty tomorrow with a focus on the deep thematics in each Throughline . <p> A ) The Influence Character deals with their Signpost which somehow influences the Main Character OR <p> B ) The Influence Character somehow influences the Main Character to deal with the Influence Character 's Signpost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the Dramatica theory book .

" Dramatica does n't have to settle on either one because they 're not mutually exclusive -- both a ) and b ) apply . They 're both correct because they both serve the same purpose by providing influence towards the Main Character 's throughline . <p> Both A and B are correct . It is the presence of Memory that influences the Main Character 's in his dealings with his personal issues . Whether it is an attribute of the Impact Character , or attributed to the Impact Character is irrelevant .

In fact , how you set up the cause and effect relationship between Action and Decision determines the entire meaning of a story , including--but not limited too--the order of thematic topics explored . <h> Examining the Order of Events <p> David Lean 's Brief Encounter ends with Alec leaving for South Africa . This is the final Story Driver as it wraps everything up . So was his leaving an Action or a Decision ? <p> You can also look to what happens after the Story Driver .

The order communicates cause and effect to the Audience . <p> A pregnant teenager getting an abortion on her own forces her parents into deciding what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not to stay with her . The Action forces a Decision ( or group of Decisions , or Deliberations ) . <p> Screenplays are not works of art . They are invitations to others to collaborate on a work of art .

Through the mechanisms and processes of character , plot , theme and genre , a story seeks to provide an audience with a better understanding of how to solve the issues they face in life .

Outside of this play , who remembers his name ? Lenny , on the other hand , found that his refusal granted him the ability to easily kill his wifes murderer , " Teddy " .

The reveal of it , while funny , cheapened the meaning of the story .

The harder he tried to climb out , the faster they went down and the separation between him and the others increased . Buzz would have still reached out his hand , leaving Woody with his Crisis decisioneither continue to fight to control the situation , or give in and grab his friends hand . Only by letting go and allowing things to take their natural course of action would his descent have finally slowed down .

Michaels love for Appollonia , Sonnys response to Connies abusethese are all problems caused by feelings . It is only once Michael stops his childish behavior and begins to employ logic over feeling that he can finally assume his rightful place in the family . This meaningful solution was only something he was able to do because of his relationship with Kaye , and to a certain extent , his father .

While the case has been made concerning the lack of meaningful story structure in this film , what ca n't be argued is the relative entertainment value of the piece . Besides the aforementioned scenes with Ken , some jaw-dropping intense set pieces and some spectacularly truthful character animation , the film connects by offering fans of the series an opportunity to say goodbye to the characters they grew up with and the characters they ultimately hold close to their hearts .

When balanced properly , a story can deliver substance and meaning on a scale unheard of in lesser delivery mechanisms . <p> Beyond offering Authors insight as to why their stories might be struggling , this understanding also allows writers to infuse their work with an originality and purpose difficult to attain through mere muscle . Recognizing the most common patterns of conflict and sampling those not-so common patterns broadens the knowledge-base of those who work in narrative fiction while freeing their imagination to consider new possibilities . <h> The Same Old Story <p> Many story gurus/theorists claim a methodical approach to story structure as the best means towards creating a story of substance .

Lacking a concrete explanation as to the meaning of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow along and hope for the best . More often than not , this approach leads to the same story , told in the same way , with little to no substance . <p> Contrast this sad result with the varied opportunities left open to writers who understand Dramaticas concept of the Four Throughlines . As we have seen throughout this series , the order or beats that a story goes through pale in comparison to the power of focusing a storys conflict on purposeful explorations of unique and connected throughlines . What there is to cover becomes far more important than hitting those beats . <p> With this approach , the writer can avoid the same ol same ol , allowing their muse to create with intent . <h> Stories of Internal Struggle <p> Complete stories cover external and internal conflicts simultaneously . Certain parts of a story will focus on the efforts in the physical world , while others will emphasize the struggle within . Hollywood tends to favor the external struggle found in situations and activities . Why ? Visual medium , visual moments of conflict . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more ponderous medium . <p> In the article on exotic story structures , conversation centered around Main Characters with deficient ways of thinking .

Hamlet , on the other hand , tells the story of men ( and a woman or two ) consumed by their obsessions and the obsessions of others . Hamlets sustained grief for his father and Claudius call for " discretion " exemplify the kind of overall story-wide conflict that comes from Problematic Fixed Attitudes . Conflict exists because of what everyone thinks , not because of their particular situation .

Amadeus did pretty well and continues to sit atop many of the " greatest films of all time " charts . For the adventurous and resolute screenwriter the challenge of visualizing the internal lies in wait . <h> The Perception of Conflict <p> With this final piece of the puzzle , this series on Conflict comes to an end .

Our personal operating systems call for conflict to fall down these lines . Because we create these stories , it is only natural that they reflect our own internal thought processes . <p> Stories are models of our own minds at work . The foundation for Dramatica sits upon this idea and instructs its every concept . Its the reason why every story written with the theory or every story that fits easily into its framework feels complete and comprehensive . As audience members , we know how we think . Stories that honor that knowledge find a special spot in our hearts and in our minds . <p> If our minds evolve then this structural chart will have to transform as well . But for now , its accuracy stays unparalleled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throughlines that attach to themare not a " system " for creating Hollywood blockbusters .

The Main Character Throughline ( marked MC here ) is always diagonally across from the Influence Character Throughline ( IC ) . Likewise , the Overall Story Throughline ( OS ) is always diagonally across from the Relationship Story Throughline ( RS ) . <p> The reasons for this are theoretical , but the general idea is that those items in greatest conflict are found diagonally across from one another in the table . That is why you find Faith diagonal to Disbelief , Perception across from Actuality ( or Reality ) , and Logic across from Feeling . The MC and IC Throughlines represent conflicting approaches to solving problems . Makes sense then that they should be across from one another . <p> This came up because the student had identified a single Throughline in a single Domain in his analysis of a film . Part of the program involves working your way through the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a better sense of where thematic conflict occurs . For instance , the first section places American Beauty , A Simple Plan , and Eat , Drink , Man , Woman together as they share a common arrangement of Throughlines ; though they deal with entirely different subject matter , they feel similar in terms of the areas of conflict explored . <p> Arguing a single Throughline in a single Domain is easy . Anyone can make an argument for a certain Main Character dealing with either a Situation , an Activity , a Fixed Attitude , or a Way of Thinking . Bring the other Throughlines into the mix and suddenly it becomes much more difficult arguing four Throughlines at once . <p> But that is the important part and where the elevation in narrative understanding comes from .

In fact , the amount to which these analogous constructs mimic and portray accurately the act of internal resolution determines how much an audience will welcome and receive a particular story . Venture too far from the beaten path so familiar to all who have a mind and one risks instant rejection and repudiation . <h> The Progress of Insight <p> As it stands now , the field of narrative science sees some seventy-five odd story appreciations that encompass and describe the mind at work .

It removes story from the anointed few , from the heroes and vaunted scribes of old , preferring instead to grant powerful new tools and insights to the many who wish to be heard and to know . By removing the speciality of " talent " from the equation and replacing it with lucid comprehension , the study of the psychological processes inherent within competent stories opens up new horizons , shuttering forever the looming shadow of simply " matching up " . <p> In short , narrative science allows the creation of starships to as yet uncharted worlds of storytelling .

However it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several Options and Missed Opportunities <p> At first , it appears that distressed alien Kalara ( Lydia Wilson ) will provide that much needed alternative perspective .

That would reaffirm his Steafast resolve and motivate Krall to change during that yearning look in the shard of glass . <p> Krall would be the Changed Influence Character , somehow sacrificing himself for ship and crew .

These last two categories represent my favorite kind of story . <p> Why ? Because to me they more closely resemble real life . <p> Sure , there are times when I succeed in my goals and feel really great about it . Likewise , there are moments when I fail in my efforts and feel really miserable about it ( unfortunately more the latter , than the former ) . But rarely does life ever work out this nicely . More frequently , I find that I achieve my goals at the expense of my own personal life or I find that failing miserably turned out to be the best thing for me . Either way , it seems these outcomes happen more often than all-out triumphs or tragedies . <p> The only drawback with identifying these kinds of stories is that there is n't a great one-word term to explain them like there is with triumphs or tragedies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but even this is n't as accurate as it should be . Which is more prevalent , the bitter or the sweet ? And to what part of the story does it apply ? Bittersweet accurately describes the general feeling these kinds of stories have , but its not too helpful in the actual creation of a story . <p> Because the Main Character is such an integral part of a storys meaning it can sometimes be helpful to use their emotional state as a kind of benchmark by which to evaluate the ending of a story . With this in mind , the " Bittersweet " ending can be divided into two categories : the Personal Triumph story and the Personal Tragedy story . The second ( my ultimate favorite ) will be looked at in greater depth in the following article , but for now , I 'd like to focus on the sweeter part of bittersweet . <h> The Personal Triumph <p> These are the stories where the good guys lose , yet the Main Character goes home happy .

However , even though she blew it , she still ends up gaining Mirandas approval . The good guy ( or in this case gal ) loses , yet goes home happy a perfect example of a Personal Triumph story . <p> In Donnie Darko , the same kind of ending exists .

Although we do n't  see the actual act , its safe to assume that his relationship with Gretchen has grown to a point where he does n't  feel like he s alone in the world anymore ( i.e , they slept together ) . Donnie has love . The Main Character , who started out in a catatonic state , ends up going home happy . <p> But where does this leave the rest of the world ? <p> Unfortunately , Donnies acceptance of his own death reverts the Primary Universe back to its miserable state . The alienation and the fixed conservative attitudes , which are the real source of the problems in the story , continue on . <p> Gretchen asks Donnie , " Wouldnt it be great if we could go back in time and erase all that pain and suffering ?

He found a connection that he never thought he would and felt that that was enough of a life . <p> The Main Character goes home happy , yet the world as a whole , the " good guys " that we are rooting for , end up losing . <p> Last up is the Academy Award-winning Rain Man .

The themes are more complex , the areas of conflict unique and surprising . Giving the audience what they expect is fine in some respects , but sometimes it can be helpful to turn things on their side and look at the problems and conflicts we face from a different point-of-view . <p> This is all the structural chart is saying . It is not dictating what to say or how to say it , it is merely giving Authors with the knowledge of what it is they are trying to say and the tools to broadcast that message . Crafting a story with this natural story structure in mind guarantees the easily delivery of the purposeful writers meaningful agenda .

One explores trouble in the act of rebelling , the other in the act of revenge . Seeking the source of conflict in both films helps to delineate possible alternatives to story structure . <p> Once a writer masters the application of the Four Throughlines to story , their next step lies in understanding the difference between the Concerns of the Throughlines . Each Throughline maintains a different perspective on the storys central inequity and therefore sees the results of that conflict in a contrasting light . Though varied , the Concerns of each Throughline share narrative common ground . <p> If one Throughline focuses on Concerns of the Past , then the other Throughlines will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conceptualizing . A commonality exists between these Concerns that is felt more than intellectualized . If a Throughline focuses on Concerns of the Future , then the other Throughlines concentrate on Concerns of Obtaining , of Innermost Desires , and of Changing Ones Nature . Again , common Concerns different perspectives . <p> These common Concerns set the narrative structure in such a way that they distinguish themselves from one another . Films set in the Past , Understanding , Memories , and Conceptualizing deviate from films set in the Future , Obtaining , Innermost Desires , and Changing Ones Nature . <p> This is what happens with Star Trek and Star Wars . <h> Problems with Activities <p> At first it may seem that both films lie in the same position on the Dramatica Table of Story Elements . After all , they both find conflict as a result of the efforts to destroy entire worlds . It is where that conflict brews up from , however , that is key to unraveling their unique narrative structures . <p> True , both Star Wars and Star Trek find their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of home worlds , each film explores epic space battles and honest-to-goodness hand-to-hand combat . But they deviate the the next level down on the chart , separating their Concerns into two distinct areas . <p> The Concern of a Throughline is the focal point for conflict in that Throughline . In an Activity story , the Concern could be the struggle towards Understanding something new ( Inception ) . It could be conflict encountered Learning something new ( Contact ) . It could be the fight to engage in Doing whatever it takes to beat the bad guys ( the original Ghostbusters ) . Lastly , it could be the attempt to Obtain something sought after for many years ( The Treasure of the Sierra Madre ) . <p> You can not describe an Activity any other way without using one of these four terms . Star Wars and Star Trek use these last two , respectively . <h> Finding the Concerns <p> When you want to find the Concern of a Throughline , you need to ask Where is the source of conflict coming from ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clues as to the structural elements . Star Wars spends an awful lot of time Obtainingstealing plans , hiding plans , and getting those plans back home . But Obtaining fails to describe accurately the source of conflict in that film . <p> The Narrative First Podcast Episode #10 : Supercharging the Conflict In Your Story discusses the need to see Dramaticas work as indicating the source of conflict in the story , not the story itself . Dramatica looks at the structural elements of a narrative , not how those elements relay themselves to an Audience . Star Wars does spend a considerable amount of time telling a story about Obtaining , but it is in the Doing that it finds actual conflict . <p> If you know where the conflict is coming from , then removing that source of inequity should remove any conflict in the story . This is the thought process behind the litmus tests discussed in the article Understanding the Personal Goal of Your Main Character . Remove what you think is a source of conflict from a story and see if conflict still existsif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict . <h> The Concern of Star Wars <p> If Obtaining , or trying to achieve something , were the source of conflict in Star Wars then that would mean if they stopped trying to obtain then every with would be OK . Is that true ? If the Rebels simply returned the plans to Darth Vader and did n't  try to destroy the Death Star would everything in that story world be OK ? <p> No . <p> You would still have an overbearing Empire imposing its rule on subjugated citizens driven to rebel . You would still have an Empire feeling it necessary to blow up peaceful planets from time-to-time to insure their rule . And you would still have a Rebel faction continuation to instigate insurgencies here and there throughout the galaxy . <p> The problem would still exist . <p> The source of problems in the original Star Wars is n't achieving or destroying something , it is the actual act of rebelling . It is the Doing , not the Obtaining . <p> Those numbskulls who do n't  realize The MacGuffin is a Joke and claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story going " are right.1 Whether or not the plans are obtained is inconsequential to the actual conflict presented in the film . <h> Of Goals and Consequences <p> The conflict in Star Wars finds its source in the act of rebelling . If you remove that act , if the Rebels stopped doing all of that pesky rebelling , then there would no longer be any problems in that world . Grand Moff Tarkin and the rest of his cronies would n't feel it necessary to test their super laser and the rest of the galaxy would live in relative peace . <p> Of course , they would be pretending that everything is hunky-dorey as one must when living under the rule of an Empire . But that acquiescence works within the narrative structure . Playing a Role , or Pretending that Everything is OK , is the Overall Story Consequence of Star Wars . In fact , any story with an Overall Story Concern of Doing will have a Consequence of Being because a narrative with an Overall Story Concern of Doingalso has an Overall Story Concern of Doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goal of a Throughline because it exists on the Type level of the Dramatica Table of Story Elements . The Type level contains all the Signpostsor Actsof a Throughline and therefore feels the closest to Plot . Goals are the closest thing you can get to a plot element of structure . <p> The Consequence also finds itself on the Type level as it determines what will happen if the Goal of a story is not achieved . It functions as a motivator for characters to move towards resolution . The Protagonist of a story moves towards the Goal while the Antagonist works for the Consequence . Luke and his buddies move towards rebelling ( Doing ) while Grand Moff and his cronies work for living life under Empire rule ( Playing a Role ) . <p> Thus , the Goal of Star Wars is not to simply " blow-up the Death Star " , it is to rebelto find a way to rebel or Do against an Evil Empire . And they do find a way once Luke turns off his targeting computer . <h> The Concern of Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trek , one might ask Why then is this an Obtaining story ? Using the same kind of litmus test used on Star Wars , we can determine whether the conflict is coming from Doing or Obtaining . <p> If the source of conflict in Star Trek came from the Doingthe attacking of ships , the time-traveling , and the battling of space-monstersthen that would mean removing those sources would end the conflict in the story . Unfortunately unlike Star Wars , if you removed the Doing from Star Trek , there would still be conflict because there would still be something left not yet achieved . <p> This is because Star Trek is a revenge story . Like Unforgiven , Star Trek is all about payback and making people pay for the sins they committed . Nero ( Eric Bana ) wants Spock to pay for letting Romulus perish in the supernova and eventually wants Earth to perish as well . Until that debt is paid , conflict will continue to exist . Only with his sense of righteousness assuaged , would the story end . <p> That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> The Search for Conflict in a Story <p> Unraveling the pieces of narrative structure is a difficult process , not only after the fact but during the creation process as well . When stuck , this mantra for story structure saves the day : If you remove what you think is the source of conflict and there is still trouble there then you have n't identified the source of conflict . <p> Both Star Trek and Star Wars may be set in space , but the narrative structural material they explore is literally from two different worlds . Star Wars explores the problems of fighting back and rebelling and testing out new weapons systems . Star Trek explore the problems of seeking revenge and destroying homeworlds as a way of getting back at someone . While on the surface they may seem similar , deep down they could n't be more alien . <p> But not in the way they think they are . They 're right because the MacGuffin is inconsequential to understanding how narrative actually works . ? ?

Lacking greater insight into why some stories work better than others , these very same people take the time-tested , yet often failed approach of " We 'll know it when we see it .

In addition to the superb acting and deft directing , the film exudes a confident , subtle and well-balanced narrative--clues that the film contains a solid storyform . <p> A storyform--as defined by the Dramatica ( narrative science ) theory of story--identifies the central thematic elements of a complete narrative . Listing close to seventy-five key story points , this structural imprint holds within it the meaning or " message " of a story . Analyzing a film by looking for these key story points allows writers to better understand how to apply the predictive nature of the storyform to their own work . <h> The First Go-Round <p> I originally completed my first analysis of this spectacular film last September . The storyform I settled on at that time was--for the most part--accurate , but there were a few areas where it did n't feel quite right to me . A proper storyform sings out--like an orchestra playing together in harmonious brilliance--and this one did n't quite ring true to me . A few sour notes that left me feeling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take another crack at it in one of my Story classes at the California Institute of the Arts , I jumped at the chance to find the right tune . <p> While 75% of this second attempt ended up matching my initial assessment , I did make one slight adjustment . I say slight because its an easy thing to do within the software application , but theoretically , it 's actually a pretty major shift . Instead of seeing Nader 's problems as a matter of his obstinate attitude--which he clearly has--we looked at him from the perspective of his manipulations . Every problem he has , everything that defines who he is , comes as a result of his constant drive to change the way people think and how they think about him . More importantly though , this way of thinking causes problems for him . Shifting the context of his personal Throughline to something more psychological in nature--while a simple click of the mouse--in reality , opened up a whole new perspective on his personal troubles . <p> Drilling down into Dramatica 's structural model beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> This quad of elements sang out for a couple of reasons . The first was the word Cause--namely because that was the precise Main Character Problem I had identified in my initial analysis . Dramatica defines Cause as : <p> the specific circumstances that lead to an effect . The character containing the Cause characteristic is concerned with what is behind a situation or its circumstances . <p> Nader 's problems stem from his overwhelming desire to establish blame and from his desire to avoid taking any blame for anything . His wife leaving him , Razieh 's " accident " , why Razieh was even there in the first place : all of these exemplify a character driven and blinded by Cause . <p> More importantly , however , this quad stood out because the elements within sang together in a harmonious reflection of Nader . Like the entire storyform itself--albeit at a finer resolution--these elements grouped together holistically painted a picture of Nader 's flawed character I 'm sure the Author intended . <h> A Holistic Model of Intent <p> In short , the storyform defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his or her work . Strong powerful films exist as strong powerful films because they have something they 're trying to say , something they 're trying to argue . More than a sequence template to follow , the storyform outlines the key points needed to make a solid argument . Solid argument , solid story , no plot holes , happy Audience . <p> Now some films , or stories for that matter , have no real purpose beyond simple entertainment ( Fletch , Battle : Los Angeles , or 2012 to name a few ) and that 's OK--Dramatica ca n't really help with those kinds of films . But when it comes to films that really matter , the ones that strive to be something even greater than the sum total of their parts , concepts like the storyform help explain why the greatness . <h> The Magic of Dramatica <p> By selecting Cause as Nader 's Main Character Problem , Dramatica took the initiative and calculated the rest of the thematic material needed to tell a compelling story . Yes , that 's right . The power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradigm of story , lies in its ability to take the parts of your story you know and provide with the bits you have n't even thought of yet . By analyzing your initial intent , the program can predict what you need in the other Throughlines in order to balance out your story and make it feel complete . <p> All that was left now was to take a look at what Dramatica predicted the Overall Story Throughline of A Separation to be and see if that matched up with the actual film : <p> Amazing ! If there was one thing clear about the Overall Story of this film--the part of the story that affects everyone--it was the broken system of justice within Iran . Proving one 's innocence within the judge 's small cramped office , waiting amongst the hoarded outside to even get in--all of these perfectly illustrated an Overall Story Problem of Process : <p> the mechanism through which a cause leads to an effect . A Process is a series of interactions that create results . syn. chain of interactions , manner of procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This was yet another key point I had selected in my original analysis . You may wonder then , if the Overall Story Problem and the Main Character Problem matched the first attempt , what exactly changed ? Remember that " slight " shift in perspective I made earlier ? By doing this , the other two items in both quads switched from Proven and Un-proven to Accurate and Non-Accurate . <p> In my original analysis I had felt the former pair ( Proven and Un-Proven ) correctly identified what a majority of the story was about . While the individual Problems of the Throughlines drive a story forward , it is the other pair within the quad that occupies most of the story 's attention . The characters in A Separation certainly spend a fair amount of time trying to prove the unproven . <p> But when one takes a closer look at Accurate and Non-Accurate and sees them more as Appropriate Behavior and Inappropriate Behavior ( synonyms respectively ) one begins to gain a greater sense of what the film was really exploring thematically . Nader calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling at his Razieh for working for a single man , or Razieh calling up her religious order to determine whether or not helping an ailing old man to clean himself ( who just wet himself from Alzheimer 's ) was an appropriate action for her to take--all of these describe characters balancing the demands of appropriate and inappropriate behavior . As with Nader 's quad of elements these four perfectly encircled the dramatic energy present within this great film . <p> In the second part of this series , we 'll explore what all of this means and how understanding the storyform can help Authors craft films as equally as powerful as this one . <p> May 23 , 2013 <h> A Separation : Predicting Greatness <p> For years , the crafting of a solid story required little more than the ability to guess . Writing . Rewriting . Repeat ad nauseam until the work found its voice . The challenge always seemed to be finding the necessary pieces to tell a complete story . <p> Until now . <p> Instead of leaving purpose to chance , the Dramatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clues to this process of " unearthing the bones " . No longer a case of crossing fingers and biting lips , writing a story that satisfies and fulfills now comes with an enlightening roadmap . <p> As discussed in the first article in this series , A Separation : Blueprint of a Masterpiece , the storyform paints a holistic footprint of a story 's thematic make-up . Choosing to focus one part of a story on a certain point-of-view demands that complimentary and opposing points-of-view come into play as well . As we saw with the juxtaposition of appropriate and inappropriate behavior both in Nader 's storyline and in the larger storyline of modern life in Iran , alternate points-of-view help define the Author 's " message " and give purpose to stor . <h> Revelation Upon Revelation <p> Further examination of the storyform Dramatica predicted for A Separation proved just as exhilarating as the first revelation . Take for instance the concept of the Overall Story Catalyst and the Overall Story Inhibitor . As defined by the theory , these two claim responsibility for increasing or decreasing conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singled out Confidence as the Catalyst and Knowledge as the Inhibitor . Perfect ! Every time a character proceeds with confidence--Nader 's strong sense of innocence , Hodjat 's defense of his wife in court--conflict in the story builds . Likewise , any time Knowledge comes into play--as when Razieh reveals knowledge of her accident the night before--the story slows to a halt . <p> What other understanding of story can even come close to this kind of narrative thematic prestidigitation ? ! <p> Without going into too much more detail , these amazing predictions continue on through out the entire storyform . Confident as we had finally found " the one " , we concluded class that night resolved with a better understanding of why this film worked so well . More importantly , the process of analysis granted each of us greater insight towards how to apply the same successful thematic exploration in our own work . <h> When Instinct Fails <p> And so there it was . <p> Without actually sitting down and watching A Separation , Dramatica was able to confidently predict how the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Why is this so important for writers ( and for those struggling to bring a story together ) ? <p> If you know your Main Character as well as Asghar Farhadi , the writer of A Separation clearly did , but you are n't sure where to take the Overall Story or any of the other characters , Dramatica can predict for you the necessary story points you need to complete the narrative . Not sure how to increase conflict in the Overall Story ? Apply a hint of the Overall Story Catalyst as described above and you 're good to go . Not sure how to develop that key Relationship Throughline ? Look to the Relationship Story Signposts and craft your work accordingly . Regardless of what story point you need help with or are blind to see yourself , the Dramatica theory of story can help make your story solid and meaningful . <h> Magic in the Real World <p> Experiences like this help solidify the uniqueness of Dramatica 's approach to story . By inputting the qualities of a single character the theory predicts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But wonder like this means nothing without some greater purpose behind it . <p> Take a look at that last element in Nader 's quad , the one we have yet to discuss--Effect . If Nader 's problem is Cause then his Solution to that problem is Effect . <p> But he never gets there--and I believe that 's key to what this film is all about . <p> Nader is a Steadfast character which means that his point-of-view , his perspective towards things , remains consistent . His pride and his confidence in his own innocence so overwhelms him that he never takes time out to see the effects his behavior has on those around him--especially his daughter . <p> Thus , the central tragedy of the film actually finds itself encoded into the structural meaning of the story : Nader 's steadfast prideful manipulations drive his daughter to a point where she abandons her original point-of-view and chooses one parent over the other . Up until that final scene his daughter went with the flow--engaging in the process of separation without really dealing with any of the residual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choice and risk hurting the other parent . Unfortunately her father brought her to a point where she had no other choice but to live with the repercussions of divorce . <p> The Story Outcome of Failure and the Story Judgment of Bad categorize this change as Tragic . A Separation succeeds on so many levels because it depicts the results of divorce--both personally among individuals , interpersonally between parents and children , and globally amongst the citizens of a progressing nation dealing with a separation from the old ways and old bonds towards a new and uncertain future . <p> See how the storyform labels the Story Consequence as Progress ? The Consequence occurs when the efforts to reach the Story Goal fail , and fail they do in this film . The tragic consequences of progress in Iran--that 's the deeper meaning of this film and the true purpose of the narrative . Modern Iran , with its children having to choose one " parent " over the other , finds progress a tragic process--a no-win situation regardless of which path they choose--the fallout of which results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losers on both sides . <h> Structure and Proof <p> Dramatica did more than predict story points , it gave us a blueprint of the Author 's original intent--his purpose in writing this powerful and moving story . <p> A Separation scores 99% on Rotten Tomatoes because it tells a solid and purpose-driven story . The filmmaker had something very meaningful to say and he did it both competently and artfully . Dramatica and its concept of the storyform helps explain the former . Talent takes care of the latter .

They sense the benefit of a new story point for their writing and quickly add it to their tool belt . The problem lies in assuming this new understanding a lone operator . <p> Six years of teaching Story Development at California Institute of the Arts granted me insight into common mistakes Authors make . In this case , many of the students within the Character Animation program would pick and choose from the various story points I would present them . They would grab and use the ones that made those most sense , and then toss aside those that did n't  seem to apply . <h> The Same Story <p> Tasked with creating short 2-minute films , these filmmakers wasted no time assigning their characters a specific problem . They understood the need to have a character driven by some flaw and successfully incorporated this point of story within their films . Yet many would fall into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . <p> Whatever their characters were driven by , they simply had them stop doing it . A guy chasing after a girl stopped chasing . A kid driven to succeed in business stopped trying . An artist working on a project gave up . Across the board the consensus was : have your character stop what they 're doing and all will be fine . <p> One must remove the possibility of hunger in order to overcome this cycle . Take a pill . Rewire the digestive system . Real problems require real solutions , fighting symptoms does nothing as the potential for conflict remains . <p> This same process drives characters . <h> A Short Story Problem <p> Let 's say we have a character with a gambling problem . More specifically , let 's give her an obsession with winning the perfecta down at the track . At the end of the story we want her to overcome her gambling addiction . We do this by having her simply stop gambling . <p> The end . <p> But does that feel complete ? <h> A Solution for Every Problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists . In the example above , our gambler has a problem of Pursuitshe keeps chasing that high , keeps running after that next win . The solution for Pursuit is Avoid ( or Prevent ) . In order for our character to overcome her gambling addiction , she will have to actively avoid or prevent herself from going to the track . " I 'm never going back there again " or paying the security guards at the gate to keep her from going in would signify a real resolution of her personal problems . <p> Simply stopping pursuing does not accomplish the same result . <p> A characters problem causes them tremendous grief . From the context of their point-of-view , their problem drives their throughline . In our example of the gambler , every trouble she experiences stems from this pursuing . Not pursuing simply turns down the dial on her problem . It does n't  resolve her gambling addiction . It turns down the dial enough that the character thinks ( or in this case , the subjective writer thinks ) that they have resolved things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem returns and it becomes clear the character has not resolved a thing . <h> Beneath the Surface <p> Going to zero does not mean off . The problem does n't  go away , it simply diminishes to a point where one is no longer aware of it . The waves of trouble the problem creates seem to go away , but the problem itself does n't  disappear . Its still there , waiting to rise again . <p> Consider the earthquake and the tsunami . If the tsunamis is the apparent problem , then the earthquake that caused it is the actual source of the problem . The tsunami wrecks havoc and then dissipates , capturing the brunt of our attention . You could perhaps find a way to combat the tsunami or stop earthquakes from creating tsunamis , but you would n't really be solving anything . As soon as another earthquake hits , the tsunmai would return and whose to say this time it wont be even stronger then the defenses you 've created . <p> Contrast this with actually taking action to prevent earthquakes from happening in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tsunami because you would be addressing the actual problem at its source , not its symptom . The tsunamis would never return . <p> This is the kind of change characters need to resolve their problems . <h> The Reason for Bookends <p> Characters focus on the symptoms of the problems affecting them . They cant see their actual problem and thus any effort given to overcome them would never completely resolve their issues . By employing the solution to their problem , characters resolve the inequity within them and the problem no longer exists as a problem . They resolve things by changing the context . <p> This is why many Authors resort to bookend scenes . By presenting their characters within the same situation they can show an Audience how the context has changed for that character . In Hamlet , Hamlet is told that his uncle killed his father . By the victim no less ! What does he do ? He thinks it away , convinces himself otherwise . Later on he sees his mother die from a drink handed to her by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? No , he acts right away secure in the knowledge that his uncle did it . <p> Same situation , different context . <p> These bookend scenes test a Main Character . It gives them an opportunity to show that their behavior has changed , that their context for approaching problems has changed . More importantly it grants an Author the chance to define what it is they want to say with their work . <p> In a closed story , an Author wraps things up . A complete story has meaning , it has edges . By changing the context from which a character approaches a problem , the Author opens up the possibility of putting things in a different context . He or she defines the edges of a story by completing it and presenting the potential for a new story . <p> Ambiguitiy curses good narrative . By refusing to define where they stood on a parituclar issue many of my students failed to actually say something with their work . Their films were forgotten minutes later . Many writers I consult with suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Character <p> Problems do n't  make sense in an of themselves when it comes to story . Like most story points , problems must be seen in the context of everything else around them . They come with symptoms and responses to those symptoms , they come with solutions and goals and consequences towards not achieving those goals . <p> The problem with most of my students ( and more accurately the way I was teaching it at the time ) was that they were simply thinking of the problem itself . Their character had a problem with chasing after their dreams , so they stopped chasing . End of story . The students felt this worked because they werent thinking of the entirety of a problem within a character , they werent thinking of the symptoms , the solution or any consequence towards their characters failing . <p> They were focusing on one story point . <p> Dramatica , and more specifically the Dramatica concept of a storyform , presents a holistic framework for an argument.1 The storyform argues for a particular approach to solving problems . Taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole purpose of the storyform and removes any potential gain such an understanding could give to an Author .

@@119273503 @8273503/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Dramatica And The Importance Of Relationships <h> The key to really getting Dramatica is to understand that it is all about the narrative relationships the theory models . <p> Dramatica is a complex and complicated theory of narrative and it has to be : it models the way our minds solve problems . Those new to the theory often make assumptions about what Dramatica is and what it is n't . Writers new to the theory can save themselves a world of hurt by understanding the thought process behind the development of the actual model . <h> Its All About the Relationships <p> The Dramatica Table of Story Elements is certainly intimidating . 340 separate elements arranged in a complex grid system that bears no resemblance to the Heros Journey " circle " model or the Save the Cat ! exclamation point model . <p> One look and many writers scoff at the obtuse terminology . Situation ? Developing a Plan ? Preconditions ? What do any of these have to do with storytelling ? <p> Still others writers make a different and potentially more inaccurate assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  . <p> The grid system is not about those elements : its about their relationship between each other . <p> That statement is Earth-shatteringly important . Trust me , it has taken me twenty years to understand this . If there is anything you can learn from us and this site it is this : Dramatica is not about the terminology , it is about the relationship between the terminology . Those elements , and the story point labels Dramatica applies to them are about the relationships within the model , not about the things themselves . <h> Its Not About the Labels <p> A story point in Dramatica labels the Main Character 's Approach as either being a Do-er or a Be-er . While Main Characters can do both , they will have a preference for either first trying to change the world around them ( Do-er ) or first trying to change themselves to suit the world ( Be-er ) . Andrew from Whiplash prefers to drum his way to success , Hamlet prefers to think himself into oblivion . One would then assume then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Wrong . <p> A Do-er or a Be-er is not about a label for the Main Character , its about a label in its relationship to other labels . By choosing the Approach for the Main Character , you 're not making that choice in isolation : by choosing that Approach , you 're also choosing the Approach of their Influence Character in the story . Andrew naturally finds Terrence intimidating everyone around him with his obnoxious attitude ; Hamlet has the ghost of his father wandering the parapets of the castle influencing others to action . <p> If you label the Main Character a Do-er , you 're simultaneously labeling the Influence Character a Be-er . Likewise you label the MC a Be-er , the IC will be a Do-er . <p> This relationship is how a writer can predict elements of their story.1 <p> Now , there is some inherent nature to these elements , but knowing the inherent nature of one element does not necessarily define the inherent of what something else is unless you say they are both of a certain family . <h> The Family Umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between those elements.Do-er is an umbrella over Situation and Activity along the top level of the Table of Story Elements . Be-er is an umbrella over Fixed Attitude and Manipulation located below Situation and Activity , but along the same top level . <p> While there may be other umbrellas currently not defined by the Dramatica theory of story , its important to know that every one presented has a purpose and a relationship to something else . They do n't  happen in isolation as they are not single points of entry into a narrative . <p> For instance , there is another story point Dramatica sees known as the Main Character Growth . This story point basically defines the character arc so many writers and producers are obsessed with . This story point labels the Main Character as someone who needs to grow by Stopping something or by Starting something new . Luke needs to stop whining about being stuck on a farm and Rick needs to start sticking his neck out for someone . <p> But you see , the Main Character Growth can have the same exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same because if you have a Main Character who falls under Situation and an Overall Story that falls under Activity , you 're going to have a Stop story : the Main Character Growth will be the exact same thing as labeling the Main Character a Do-er . <p> Trippy , right ? <p> The application is presented as a bunch of switches and buttons that set the structure of a story , but really its all about identifying the relationships between things . There is no such thing as a Problem . No such thing as a Solution . Only the relationship between something we see as separate from ourselves and our own internal desires that we blind ourselves to . <p> Switching back to our example above , the Main Character is of two families . She is in the Do-er family , paired with Activity . And she is a Stop character , which means she is also paired with Activity . <p> Two labels that mean two different things that by definition , are identical because the choice is not between one inception point of narrative : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Using Labels to Narrow Down Point of View <p> The questions Dramatica asksis the Main Character a Do-er or a Be-er , is the Main Character Growth Stop or Start , do not presuppose knowledge of where the Main Character falls in the Table of Story Elements . A writer does n't  have to know where the Main Character is by choosing Do-er or Be-er , he or she is simply narrowing down the options . <p> If you choose Stop and Do-er , you still do n't  who your Main Character is . If you have Start and Do-er , you still do n't  know who your Main Character is . But the moment you assign the Main Character , then you know all of them . <h> The Dynamic Pair Relationship <p> It is also helpful to know that the model is based on Dynamic Pair relationships , meaning those items diagonally across from each other carry the most significance within the model . Other umbrellas would need to honor this dynamic pair relationship . <p> Choosing Do-er or Be-er is selecting part of a dynamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that your Influence Character will fall into the other . A writer understands both sides of the dynamic pair by defining one . <h> A Model of Relationships , Not Things <p> Hopefully you have the word relationship beaten into your head by now . That 's all you 're looking at when you look at that intimating Table of Story Elements and when you 're trying to determine Do-er or Be-er , Stop or Start , Linear or Holistic , Changed or Steadfast . Each one of those dynamic questions carries with it a prediction of where the other dynamic pair will fall . That 's where you find the meaning.2 <p> Dramatica looks mechanical on the surface , it looks reductive and restricting .

Super smart philosophy majors might call this gestalt , but as far as Dramatica is concerned an inequity--or imbalance seen between two things--is the fuel for narrative conflict . Once identified , our minds have to either work to solve that inequity or find an opportunity to balance it away in a process known as Justification .

You 're gon na want to take some notes <p> Every idea you have , every single solitary conception that you do n't  want lost in the morass of your own memories needs to end up as a Simplenote entry . Your initial inspirations for a story , detailed character sketches , biographies and backstories , scene ideas , plot points , meaningful moments , even bad ideasanything and everything that comes to mind during the development of a story should end up in this program . There simply is no other better alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ease of use . You open the app , press the + sign and you 're ready to write . Want to append something to a previous note ? Type in some keywords into the search box and within seconds your previous thought will be shown to you , ready for the modification . That 's really all the program does . It does n't  store images , web pages or PDFs <p> But that simplicity is its strength . <p> While there are other more robust applications like Evernote ( which has other uses that will be explored below ) and extremely gorgeous note-taking apps like AwesomeNote , Simplenote wins hands down because it is so damn fast . With these other apps it seems like the focus on presentation obstructs the creative writing process ; the pretty pixels get in the way . Simplenote is definitely boring to look atmundane at bestbut has the pleasant after effect of freeing up the creative receptors of your brain for the true task at hand . Your original idea sits center stage , basking in the peace of minimalist UI . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sync button ? Everyone does . AwesomeNote syncs with Evernote , but you have to go the Home screen , hit the Sync button , then hit Sync Now , then wait forever for the actual thing to sync four or five notes . Evernote syncs automatically , but still seems to take longer than SN . To be fair , this has been drastically improved with the latest iOS and corresponding phone , and it may have much to due with the various types of media that Evernote can store and scan . But when it comes to jotting down that character moment or that scene turn you do n't  want to forget , SimpleNote is the superior tool . <p> In fact , Simplenotes syncing is so wonderful that it syncs as you type , destroying the need for a Sync or a Save button . You basically open the program and just begin spilling out your thoughtsno concepts , no titles , just thoughts . Simple and effortless . <h> Notational Velocity <p> Like Simplenote there is no manual saving in Notational Velocity , all updates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts , no folders , the first sentence of your note becomes the title , and all of it is easily searchable within the searchbox . But the really killer feature happened earlier this year when the creators of NV flipped the switch for syncing with Simplenote . <p> Most , if not all , of the actual writing of a screenplay should take place in a professional desktop screenwriting program . The reasons for this will become clearer later on , but for now , suffice it to say that the best writing comes when a writer sits before a large screen , one large enough for both an entire page of a screenplay and the notes the writer took since their last writing session . <p> With the NV/Simplenote sync in place , those notes are always sitting there waiting for a writer to act upon . Every thought notated on the iPhone waiting in line , every dialogue snippet realized on the iPad moments before heading off to bed , every last idea is there , waiting in that simple , bleak window . No elaborate sync @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Velocity is to treat each entry as you would a 3x5 note card . One item , one detail . " Title : Jaws Inciting Incident , Body : Chrissie gets chomped . " " Title : Reds Leap of Faith , Body : Red tells them he does n't  give a damn what they think . " NVs search engine works better when information is distributed across the notes and thus , short notes like this are the way to go . Avoid stacking multiple character descriptions and long outlines within a single note and you 'll do great . <p> So if the Simplenote + Notational Velocity combination works great for quick blurbs of information , where should a writer keep their long form material like outlines , treatments and the actual screenplay itself ? <h> Dropbox <p> While inspiration is reserved for Simplenote , program-specific files , extended length material and important reports are perfect for the big box in the virtual sky . <p> Think of Dropbox as your own portable USB drive that you can instantly access anywhereyour iMac in your home office , your iPad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPhone as you wait for a meeting to start . When installed on a Mac it creates an easily accessible folder in the Finders left-hand sidebar where you can Drag n Drop to your muses content . <p> Writers are no longer restricted to practicing their craft in one specific place . Some prefer the coffee shop , some prefer a sandy beach , while there are still those who prefer the dark dungeon of their own home office . This mobility , and the variety of devices that such transportability calls for , requires a service like Dropbox to bridge the gaps between the different locations . <p> Working on the fifth or sixth draft of your current screenplay in Screenwriter ? Make sure you save it to a folder marked " Stories " in your Dropbox . Now , when you get the urge to write , no matter where you are , no matter whether you have your laptop with you or your back home on your iMac , simply open up your Dropbox folder and select the latest version . <p> Of course , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record of previous versions of a file for the past 30 days . Accidentally saved that latest draft with the previous drafts name ? Ready to toss your computer out the window ? ! No need to . Simply Ctrl+click on the file name , select the previous version and you 'll be ready to go . <p> If you collaborate with another writer , you can even set up one of your folders as a Public folder and grant your writing partner access to it . Whether its character designs or the latest treatment , simply drop the appropriate item in the folder and your writing partner will be able to add their notes , crossing out what lines of dialogue and action they do n't  think work , and perhaps even add some of their own . Then , of course , you can just revert it back to your version and ignore their notes ! <p> Finally , you could store Academy Award-winning screenplays in another folder labeled " Scripts " when your own words just do n't  seem to be enough . Many writers find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're ready and eager to return to their own work . Dropbox makes sure that inspiration is always a simple swipe and tap away . <h> Evernote <p> Earlier this app was downplayed for its cumbersome interface and complexity of features . This downfall is precisely what makes it such a great tool for a writers virtual reference notebook . <p> Simplenote/NV is great for inspiration and Dropbox is great for maintaining working project files . But when it comes to quick and easy access to the mountains and mountains of insightful articles available on the Internet today , Evernote is your old reliable friend . Unlike the previous two that focused more on inspiration , this app is all about organization . The key is their concept of maintaining your notes into separate collections called aptly enough , " Notebooks . " <p> For example , you could create a Notebook called " StoryFanatic " and drop the important and insightful articles from this site in there . Tag them with " Main Character " or " Inciting Incident " and then forget about them . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your screenplay and you sort of remember , " Wait a second , was n't there a StoryFanatic article about Act Turns ? " you could simply refer to your virtual notebook . <p> Again , no matter where you are ( access is key ) , in the parking lot of your current employer or at home in front of the TV , just fire up Evernote and search for any articles marked " Inciting Incident " . Within seconds the article you remembered will be there for you , ready to inspire and inform , and hopefully leave you energized enough to return to your own story . <p> While you could conceivably store the same information in your Dropbox , Evernote seems to work better as a one-stop shop for collecting everything . Audio notes from lectures , images captured with your phones camera that inspire different scenes , and yes , web sites that help encourage a better understanding of effective storytelling . But beyond simply a great tool for collection , Evernote works equally as well as a device for finding that information in a pinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a photo of the white board with your iPhone and place it in your " Screenwriting Seminars " notebook . Depending on how legible your instructors handwriting was , those notes on the board are now searchable from within the application . Same with handouts , course descriptions or anything else you can take an image of . Whenever something is uploaded to Evernote , its servers automatically scan the image with powerful OCR software and store that information alongside the original upload . And with the iPhone 4s improved camera resolution , the accuracy of the search engine borders on pure magic . <h> Dragon Dictation + Pastebot <p> Everyone knows how dangerous it is to text while driving . Thankfully , the combination of these two programs alleviates that danger while providing the tools necessary to capture that fleeting bit of inspiration that cant possibly survive your extended commute home . The key with these applications is the no-look one-touch operation that comes easy to drivers familiar with changing the station on their in-car stereo or blasting the A/C . <p> Upon opening Dragon Dictation , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recording begins and you speak clearly into the phone . When finished , tap the extremely large DONE button ( no need to look at the screen ) and your recording will be sent to their servers for translation . A few seconds later and the text version of your audio note is presented on the screen for review . The transcribing is not 100% accurate , especially when you 've got the windows rolled down , but rather somewhat closer to 80-85% . Still it is certainly much better than previous software attempts at voice recognition and like Evernotes ability to search handwritten text , Dragon Dictations ability to make words out of your voice approaches new levels of wonder ( note how in the screenshot to the left , it even picked up on the word totem ! ) . <p> With the latest version of DD , you simply call up the hidden menu below , click the button marked Copy ( again , nice and large so once you 're familiar with where it is , you never have to look again ) , and the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where Pastebot comes in . Simply tap on the app to open it and the contents of the clipboard are automatically dumped into one of Pastebots waiting drawers . Its that easy ! Pastebot is basically an extended clipboard , allowing you to copy and paste as many versions of the iOS clipboard as you would likein this case , audio notes from Dragon Dictation . <p> Again , Evernote has an Audio Capture feature that works fine , but if you 're the kind of person that prefers to see the notes for their project they 're working on written out , you cant do better than this combination of apps . <p> The other killer feature is Pastebots Desktop Syncing program . Once installed , you simply have to open up the app on the iPhone to have all the contents of its drawers dumped immediately into the desktop version . You can then copy and paste them into SimpleNote or take action on them right away . <h> Screenwriting Apps <p> Notably absent from this list of essential tools for screenwriters are screenwriting apps themselves . As mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed before a screen large enough to view an entire page . There is a flow , a sort of rhythm that exists within a well-written screenplay , that can only be seen and experienced by a writer when they are able to view the single page as a whole . From experience , writing a screenplay on an iPhone is about as functional as reading a novel through a cardboard paper towel roll . <p> Certainly one could make it work on the iPad versions of these programs , and perhaps the iPad version of Final Draft may be just the application that makes the strides into the mobile market , but for now , the iPad and iPhone work wonderfully as tools for collecting and maintaining inspiration . The desktop ( or laptop ) is where the real magic happens . <h> The Mobile Muse <p> With Simplenote and Notational Velocity , Dropbox , Evernote , and Dragon Dictation and Pastebot writers in the 21st century now have no excuse for losing that spark of inspiration . The muse can strike at any time , unfortunately usually when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered . With the iPhone and iPad , a writer can now organize their writing life in such a way that they can carry their cherished works of art from inspiration to execution , without hindrance . <p> With these systems in place , the lack of impediments from conception to creation insures that the final work will remain an honest and true reflection of the writer themselves . <p> Who could ask for anything more ? 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Without a doubt , the most important file you should have in your Dropbox is the Story Engine Settings Report for the story you 're currently working on .

@@119273509 @8273509/ <h> The Problem With Reverse-Engineering Dramatica <h> Unraveling the mysteries of story theory is another way of avoiding writing . <p> Interesting discussion this week over on Discuss Dramatica about the theory and how it works " behind the scenes . " To many , Dramatica is magic . You take what it gives , you feel inspired and encouraged to write with it , and you end up with a decent story that makes sense and hits quality emotional beats . <p> For others , they feel the need to pop open the hood and figure out how it all works . Like those who scour magic shops for the secret behind their favorite trick , these investigators want to know . And there 's nothing wrong with that . The theory is prescient in its ability to predict emotional sequences within a narrative . Who would n't want to know that ? <p> I know I did . In my first 3-4 years of studying Dramatica1 I used to plot my way through the Signposts , read through the patents and everything on Melanies Dramaticapedia site , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what I discovered ? <p> It was ALL a collosal waste of time . <p> Because when I was comparing the Act order for a Throughline based on the Story Outcome , I should have been writing . When I was trying to unravel the cryptic codes within the patent , I should have been writing . And when I was reading through Melanies biography to catch a glimpse of how the genius became , I should have been writing.2 <p> The point being : Dramatica is a wonderful tool for constructing a complete and emotionally compelling narrative . Writers are better served using it as a springboard rather than an excuse to tinker . The main reason I switched all my writing to simple text-based documents was because I wanted to return to writing stories . I wanted to clear the cruft so I could return to engaging in my craft . I wanted to use what the theory gave to me as a means for having my voice heard . <p> And it has made all the difference . <h> Knowing What Your Story Means <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user asks if there is a way to select the order of sequences that occur in the powerful Plot Sequences Report . Unlike plotting the course of the Act order found in the Signposts " which I understand " choosing the order of sequences seems counter-intuitive . The Dramatica storyform is an objective view of the storys events . Wanting to manipulate the Acts ( Signposts ) from this perspective makes sense . <p> The Plot Sequence Report , however , is a subjective view of the storys events from the point-of-view of the characters . Wanting to choose this would be trying to take an objective view of the subjective and now my brain hurts . Hard to imagine knowing the order in which things happen , but unaware of what I want the story to actually mean . Character Dynamics like the Main Characters Resolve or the Main Characters Approach and Plot Dynamics like the Story Outcome or the Story Judgment should come first as they represent the Authors intent . <p> The response from the user : <p> My character starts at a certain point . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening works . And I wanted to know how that might affect the ending . Because I already know how this will end . So I need a storyform that matches the beginning and ending Ive already chosen . <p> It has been my experience that no matter what you think the Signposts should be , you 're guaranteed to be disappointed when you set the Character Dynamics and the Plot Dynamics . <p> When the Dramatica theory book speaks of knowing your ending , they 're not referring to the Signposts , they 're referring to the combination of the Story Outcome and Story Judgment . If you do n't  know these two Story Points , then you really do n't  know your ending . It does n't  matter if the story ends in Conscious , Future or Becoming . You should know the Outcome and the Judgment as they project Authors Intent . Employing this solution will lead to success and happiness . Or employing this response will lead to failure and tragedy . The Signpost order will be set once you choose this ending . <p> The user believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with this is that the Concern of the Main Characters Throughline could be Impulsive Response while the actual Signpost is the Subconscious . The Concern covers the entire Throughline from Act One through Act Four . The Signpost represents one-fourth of that entire journey . And again , it is hard to tell what is what from inside the story . That 's why we have Dramatica . <p> Working this way is like saying I know what letters are going to go into this sentence one by one , but I do n't  know what I 'm actually trying to say with this sentence.The purpose of the storyform is to communicate meaning . If you do n't  know what it is you 're trying to say or argue , why would you start with the first steps of the argument ? <p> Which returns us to where we started . The purpose of Dramatica is to help you write a better story . As I tell all my clients who believe they have to answer every last question and make sure every last box is ticked , there are no awards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont help you write a better narrative or a more comprehensive meaningful narrative . <p> It will , however , show you how a Dramatica storyform is made . <h> The Viability of a Theory of Story <p> There is a tendency to understand the story engine of Dramatica as if that is going to make you a great writer . It wo n't . From my experience you would be better off using that time to take the storyform that Dramatica gives you " based on choices you made in regards to your ending and the thematic issues you want to tackle " and simply write . <p> If you know where your story starts and ends , you should know the Outcome and Judgment . You wont need to juxtapose a matrix of different endings in order to somehow divine which one is correct . I used to do this all the time when I first started , and it was such a huge waste of time . <p> StoryEncoding is not StoryForming . The order of Signposts is a part of StoryForming and helps support the argument you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Judgment . If you know these you do n't  need to know how the order of Signposts plays out " Dramatica will give it to you . <p> Twenty years ago , I invested $150 into Dramatica . I have found that initial fee a useful and viable investment that has paid itself back ten-thousand times over . And when you think about it , I do n't  know anything else from 1994 that continues to have relevance . <p> The storyform Dramatica gives you will save you time in the writing process . Hands down , it is the best way to plug those holes in your story and emerge from your next draft confident and secure . Knowing what it is you want to say , Dramatica helps you organize your thinking by gifting you the order in which you should present your thematic material .

No writer wishes to simply rehash conflicts of old . Yet , without knowing truly what it is they are writing , many authors blindly follow the well-worn path of conflict . <p> By assigning the four Throughlines of a story ( Overall Story , Main Character , Influence Character and Relationship Story ) to one of these problematic areas of conflict , a writer imbues a work of narrative fiction with a distinct tangible personality . <h> Shifting the Axis of Conflict <p> In earlier articles the Overall Story Throughline , or main area of conflict , confined itself to either Problematic Activities or Problematic Ways of Thinking ; in other words the characters as a whole beat themselves up physically or psychologically . While the majority of Western storytelling prefers this external or internal look at procedural conflict , stories do exist where the characters as a whole face conflicts of a static nature . Whether facing some Problematic Situation or Problematic Fixed Attitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck . <p> Getting that thing or things unstuck generally becomes the Goal of such a story . <h> Get Busy Living <p> In The Shawshank Redemption one would assume that Red ( Morgan Freeman ) is the one stuck , and by accepting the call to " Get busy livin " he becomes unstuck . A closer look at the structural conflicts proves this incorrect . <p> In the hallowed halls of this sad prison , lifer Red comes to meet and befriend fresh fish Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ) . This relationshipthe heart of the storyfocuses on the nature of hope and if it is " a dangerous thing . " Their conflicting attitudes about this issue puts the Relationship Throughline of this story in the Fixed Attitude section . Instantly one can sense the difference between this film and the films analyzed before . Instead of convincing one another , manipulating the other into thinking the way he or she does , the relationship now centers on two incompatible views . I think this , You think that and one of them has to change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Utilizing the reasoning elaborated on within the article Naturally Structuring a Story for Conflict , this would put the Overall Story Throughline firmly in a Problematic Situation . What is the problem that brings everyone in the story together ? An innocent man has been unjustly accused . " I 'm innocent , " Andy says . Yeah , right , and so is everyone else . They 're all stuck , and again , instead of fighting it out within the scope of activities or collectively backstabbing each other in a game of manipulations , here Stephen King explores the ups and downs of facing a problematic fixed situation . <h> Deciphering Objective and Subjective Views <p> Note the difference between this structural set-up and that of Star Wars , The Matrix or Finding Nemo . Instead of confining the static nature of conflicts surrounding Attitudes and Situations to one or two characters , a story like The Shawshank Redemption incorporates everyone into the struggle against fixation . It takes an objective view of this static area of conflict . This leaves the more process-oriented conflicts of Activities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Influence Character . <p> Red and Andy . Who suffers from a Problematic Way of Thinking and who struggles with Problematic Activities ? Think back to Reds meetings with the parole board . What issue does he run across ? To say what you think they want you to say , to think you have to kiss up and support those who hold power of you , showcases the thinking of an institutionalized man . Red says he is a changed man because he does n't  want to rock the boat , he s saying what he thinks he needs to say . That 's a character struggling with a Problematic Way of Thinking . <p> This puts Andy in the Problematic Activities area and again , yet another example of how the structural chart naturally lays out the focal points of conflict within story .

And its not like Finding Nemo or Unforgiven where that personal take on conflict focuses on a mindset that needs changing . Here you have a Main Character struggling with a dysfunctional psychology . How tantalizing ! <p> This is perhaps the reason why so many are quick to relegate Red to a " point-of-view " character or a " second protagonist " . Understanding the personal conflict of someone dealing with a Situation or an Attitude ? That 's easy , or more recognizable for most , because of the familiarity both in the sheer numbers of stories that take this approach and because of life itself .

Clearly , the Prince of Denmark struggles with his own conception of himself and how best to carry out his plana struggle with the internal process . <h> An Opportunity For Something New <p> The Dramatica structural chart affords writers the chance to write something truly unique , something truly off the beaten path . The problem is that those who produce stories generally are n't  comfortable with the new . When you consider the recent slate of filmsgeared more towards selling toys and building upon deep-rooted propertiesthe notion of diving into the intricacies of how a character thinks and the struggle to overcome deficiencies comes off unappealing , unattractive and an easy one to pass on . <p> But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance for writers to explore this uncharted territory becomes unavoidable , a siren song among the common .

Addressing these issues might have saved the film from the under-80 club . <h> Story Driver <p> For stories to argue their points effectively they need to establish impetus up front .

In the first story , the parents decision to invite suitors and the suitors acceptance of the invitation forces Merida to compete for her own hand . Had her parents and suitors decided otherwise , Merida would never have raised her bow and torn her dress . This story ends when Meridas mother Elenor capitulates and motions for Merida to break with tradition .

What can I do to fight back ? <p> In either case , the narrative breaks . The two stories do n't  form separate arguments the way one would expect when a work consists of different stories ( Jerry Maguire , As Good As It Gets or Lord of the Rings ) .

It is a moment of falsehood that happens deep within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supernova in the emptiness of space . As a fan of the film , one hopes that on subsequent viewings , this leap of character will somehow have been magically transformed into something more closely approaching truth . <p> Unfortunately that does n't  happen . <h> The Story of 3:10 to Yuma <p> 3:10 to Yuma tells the story of Dan Evans ( Christian Bale ) and his efforts to save his family farm by escorting notorious bad man Ben Wade ( Russell Crowe ) to a train station in Contention , Arizona . There is a reward for getting Wade there before the 3:10 prison train arrives and Dan intends on securing it for himself and for those he loves . <p> Dan , a Civil War veteran hampered by the loss of his left leg , finds himself in a hopeless situation . With only a drought-ridden ranch to his name and massive debt to a local wealthy rancher , Dan becomes overwrought with his inability to see to the future well-being of his family . But even more drastic is the disdain he feels from his oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenager with all the answers , William makes no effort hiding the shame he feels for his fathers apparent cowardice , going so far as to tell his Dad that " I 'm never walking in your shoes . " This tenuous relationship between father and son represents the heart of the story , its eventual catharsis the shared hope of every audience member . <p> Both William and Wade share the same drive to rush into things , to take action , and in that respect , they serve the same dramatic impact on Dans growth of character . Wade even makes the suggestion that William reminds him of himself as a young boy . Dan strenuously disagrees , and it is in this clash of perspectives that the cracks in Dans character begin to appear ; both William and Wade are of the same opinion of what it means to be a man and Dan sadly does n't  fit the bill . <p> One by one their posse whittles down until only Dan and William are left to cater Wade half-a-mile through the bounty-hunter infested streets of Contention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money than the railroad ever promised him . Dan politely declines . How could he face his son knowing that he compromised with a known villain ? <p> The two set off through the streets , pursued at every corner . $200 dollars awaits the local gunsligner who shoots Dan cold . The two dodge flying bullets as they race towards the train station . Eventually they crash into a stock room <p> And it is here where the story falls apart . <p> Wade turns the tables on Dan , telling him his journey stops here . Wade is not getting on that train . A fight erupts in which Wade manages to get the upper-hand . Under the chain-link pressure of Wades handcuffs , Dan spits out the sad story about how he really lost his legsomeone in his own Company shot him . Mention is made of how pitiful he felt relaying that story of supposed heroism to his son <p> And for some God-forsaken reason , Wade changes his mind . <h> The Correct Way to Resolve a Problem <p> Of course , this moment had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wade would run alongside Dan all the way to the train station . There has to be some reason why Wade would n't just delay Dan long enough for his deadly gang of bandoliers to save him . But there is a difference between the right reason for doing something and just any old reason . <p> There should be some connection between all that happened in the proceeding two hours and those last final moments . <p> The problems between Dan and Wade stem from Dans steadfast conscience . While others are quick to take the easy way out , Dan somehow stays in the game . This intrigues Wade and gives motivation for their friendship to develop . Thematically it is also this sense of conscience that ignites the flames of conflict between Dan and his son . With their barn on fire , William wants to rush in regardless of personal safety ; Dan stalls him , forgoing the rescue of their personal effects for fear of even deadlier consequences . <p> With conscience the major source of problems within Dans relationships , the solution rightly becomes temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  even make sense . You do n't  heal a wound by making it deeper . Yet somehow this is what they wrote into the story of 3:10 to Yuma . <p> Wades decision to loosen the pressure on Dans neck comes with an appeal from Dan to Wades sense of conscience . Telling the story of how he really lost his leg only maintains the presence of the problem between them . With their relationship continuing on the way it always has , why should Wade change ? Why does he start treating him like a friend ? <p> Wades change comes because it is necessary for the plot , not because of any meaningful character growth , and this is precisely why that moment feels false . In breaking the structure the Authors had so diligently setup in the proceeding Acts , the story broke down and audiences everywhere were left shouting at the screen ( either internally or externally ) , Why is he doing that ? ! <h> Maintaining the Integrity of the Story <p> What if instead , Dan had taken the easy way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to temptation and employed the solution to the problems between them . Wouldnt there have been at least some reason for Wade to change ? <p> Wades biggest issue was his abandonment by his mother at an early age . Through the course of the story we learn that this tragic turn of events was quite possibly the thing that made him so bad . This wonderfully simple , yet powerful backstory , explains why Wade is so intrigued with Dans sense of consciencehe never knew a parent quite like him . It is also why he plays with Dan throughout the film , checking to see the breaking points , and how he might possibly turn the crippled rancher to become more like himself . <p> So if instead of pleading to Wades sense of conscience , Dan decided to take the shortcut to success , Wade would have a reason to change and help Dan finish the journey . Why ? Wade obviously has a problem with the way he personally turned out , why would he then want the same thing to happen to William were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned " him morally by selling out ? Wade would see Dans compromise as a repeat of what his mother did to him and thus , would have a reason for taking the helpless father the rest of the way . <p> This shift in their relationship would naturally lead to Wades change of character . <p> With these new pages , Dans embrace of temptation resolves the major source of conflict between the two gunmen . With this increased understanding of one another , their friendship flourishes and they now have a viable meaningful reason for making those last precious steps towards the awaiting train . The Authors wanted this friendly repartee , almost buddy-film like conversation , as the two weaved there way form bridal suite to train station ; why not give it a viable believable reason for existing ? <p> In addition , there was a slight change to Dans backstory : his infirmary came as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound instead of the ambiguous " lost my foot during a retreat " reason given in the original screenplay . While effectively connecting Dans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wade , it also speaks volumes as to why Dan becomes so heated in regards to people helping or not helping him . Having committed the ultimate act of cowardice in the Civil War , he would think himself less than worthy of any outside assistance . <p> Again , every part of a storyeven the backstorycontributes to the overall message of the piece . <p> Of course , once in that relatively peaceful shack of protection , Dan would have to reestablish this steadfastness : <p> INT . TICKET BOOTH , TRAIN STATION - DAY <p> Inside the booth , Dan winces with the pain rippling through his body . He has GUNSHOT WOUNDS in his arms and legs . Blood also trickles from a head wound <p> Wade takes a KERCHIEF out of his pocket and begins to make a TOURNIQUET around Dans leg . <p> Dan pushes him away , refusing the assistance . Finishes it himself . <p> DAN I ai n't  stubborn <p> WADE ( confused ) What . <p> DAN At the camp , you said I was stubborn forFor keeping my family on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it . <p> DAN Its my son Mark The younger one . Got tuberculosis when he was two Doctors said hed die if he He did n't  have a dry climate . <p> WADE Whatre you telling me this for . <p> DAN ( shrugs ) Guess I wanted you to know I 'm not stubborn is all Ben . <p> Wade stares at Dans grin , and starts to smile himself . <p> Friendship sealed , personal motivating issues back on track . <p> The only change from the original material was Dans refusal of Bens help . The one thing driving Dan throughout the story was that no one ever raised a hand to help himnot even God . To accept fully Wades offer would only weaken his resolve , breaking the storys message in the process . Wade and William were the ones who were ultimately supposed to change . Danwell , Dan was supposed to be stubborn . <h> The Steadfast Main Character <p> As mentioned in the article What Character Arc Really Means , a Main Character does not have to transformationally change in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some may argue , but does n't  the suggestion of having Dan take the money classify him more as the traditional Change Main Character ? <p> Dans personal issues werent so much about doing the right thing as much as they were about doing what was needed because no one would help him . Sure , the issue of conscience was important in the context of his relationship with his son and with Wade , but personally , his steadfastness comes as a result of the problems he endures because no one will help him . Maintaining that drive signifies his staunch resolve . <p> Besides , Steadfast Main Characters are allowed to buckle ; they 're not supposed to be this one note that rings solidly from opening curtain to final credit . As long as in the end they continue to do things the way they always have , they can be accurately referred to as Steadfast . In fact , one could argue that wavering steadfast characters are more true-to-life , even more honest than their simple straight-minded cousins . <h> Truth in Structure <p> False moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and issues facing their characters . They happen when the feeling is that something is supposed to happen here , but what exactly that something unfortunately is remains elusive or unclear .

Because Dan is a Steadfast Situation Character ( lost his leg in the war ) , he finds himself driven by Help and scorned with Issues of Preconception ( what his wife and boy think of him ) . While the storyform signifies his Problem as Help , in Steadfast characters this problem is seen more as a drive than a problem . It also happens to be the reason why he needs to continue being driven by it at the end of the story . <p> William and Wade , both Change Impact Characters , end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to always jump into things head first , particularly on the part of William .

Who knowsif nothing else , it speaks highly of the programs ability to holistically map out good story sense . Ignoring Wades false moment of character , the story otherwise flows quite nicely , with an ending that is both satisfying and emotionally fulfillingthe hallmarks of any great story . <p> Whether or not it had any place in the production process at all , though , Dramatica does accurately point out the reason why that moment seems so false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Relationship Story Throughline , that is the relationship between Dan and Wade/William , suffers from a Problem of Conscience and therefore can only be resolved with a Solution of Temptation .

Continuing to employ the Problem of Conscience did nothing to shift the balance of conflict in their relationship and explains clearly why this was a false moment of character .

Structure exists to grant Audiences a better appreciation of the problems in their lives . The narratives ability to shift contexts while looking at the same thing presents an opportunity of understanding unheard of , and thus demands careful consideration . <p> Our last article , A Blueprint for Effective Character Development , discussed how to take Dramaticas sometimes cold and impersonal view of story structure and turn it into something organic and writer-friendly . Offering an approach to interpreting story points like Problem , Symptom and Response , the article focused its attention on only one Throughline : the Main Character . Main Characters do not operate in a vaccuum . They need an Influence Character to challenge their approach and a Relationship with which to grow from . And while it may seem the furthest thing away , they also need an objective look at their Responses and Resolve . They need an Overall Story Throughline . <h> Objective Take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character functions like Protagonist , Antagonist , Skeptic and Sidekick , the Overall Story Throughline presents an outside look at the problems faced by the Main Character . Sometimes referred to as the A story line , or simply plot , this Throughline compliments the other three Throughlines found in a complete story . While the Main Character Throughline offers an intensely personal , first person " I " perspective on things , the Overall Story Throughline grants an objective " They " look at what befuddles the characters . The remaining two ThroughlinesInfluence Character and Relationship Storypresent counter-arguments to those first two in the form of " You " and " We " perspectives . <p> What happens when you do n't  have all four of these throughlines ? If you 're a fan of self-inflicted pain take a night to watch National Treasure . While crafty in its hunt of hidden treasure , the film itself offers nothing in terms of emotional relevance . One can not connect to this film . The reason can be found with the complete lack of a Main Character Throughline . Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicolas Cage ) an issue with the family name , but this is quickly forgotten and never develops into moments of quiet reflection or angst regarding his true identity . Compound this with the lack of any challenging Influence Character to oppose him ( despite the obvious candidates in the form of the beautiful girl and the skeptical dad ) and the complete absence of any Relationship Story and the film quickly becomes an exercise in self-inflicted torture . <p> Crafting a story with Four Throughliens becomes priority one for writers who want to say something with their work . But even more important they need to find a way to weave the Main Characters Throughline with the Overall Story Throughline . These are n't  simply separate occurrences or disparate storylines . The Main Character and Overall Story Throughlines offer an objective and subjective look at the same problem . <h> Magic in the Machine <p> Before Dramatica , writers had to figure this out on their own and often did so by reflecting the Main Characters personal problem in the Overall Story ( or vice versa by reflecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this , audiences get an overall logistical take on how to best solve problems while at the same time receviing an intimiate look at what it feels like from inside to have these very same problems .

You can only be without . And then within . Never at the same time . This is what makes stories so special and so unique to the human experience . <h> A Way to Combine Thematic Material . <p> So how does one go about doing this ? Better yet , let 's take a look at classic stories and how the personal problems of the Main Character find themselves reflected in the larger Overall Story .

They seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Major Strasser and the Nazi party he represents seek to control every movement in and out of Europe . <p> What better way to experience this tyranny from inside than to create a character shut-off and isolated from his own feelings ? A character so determined to control his emotions that he hardly bats an eye when a teenager asks him whether or not she should sleep with the Captain of the Police in exchange for a ticket to America . Rick ( Humprey Bogart ) seeks to have control over himself every bit as much as the Nazis wish to exert their control over the citizens of Europe . By showing us an objective look on how to solve a problem of control ( " Round up the usual suspects " ) while simultaneously granting us a subjective personal take on how to overcome control ( " Heres looking at you kid " ) , Casablanca argues the very best approach to solving control : freedom . <h> The Problem with Me Me Me <p> In the Academy Award winning screenplay for her , self-absorbed hipsters attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend for juicing their fruits and eating their vegetables or walking aimlessly through downtown without recognizing a single soul , the crushing amount of self-absorbtion threatens our future selves . <p> What better to way to experience this self-centered approach than to create a character who only sees the effects of his divorce on himself ? Obssessed with his wifes anger towards him , Theodore Twombly ( Joaquin Phoenix ) becomes locked within his own memories , playing them over and over again in an effort to determine why me ? By showing how a greater awareness of his own contribution to the demise of his marraige released Theodore from his obssession while simultaneously presenting the failure that occurs when the machines seek even greater self-awareness , her argues for an end to this tendency to draw inward . <h> Adding Distance to the Problem <p> This works for half of the stories out there . Stories where the Main Character does a complete 180 on their point-of-view will find the Overall Story Throughline and the Main Character Throughline sharing the same kind of problem.2 The other half , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their core beliefs , will find the same similarity between the Overall Story Throughline and the Influence Character Throughline . The juxtapostion between between objective and subjective still exists , only in these stories the subjective is once removed . <p> For instance , in How to Train Your Dragon how else can you make the struggle to overcome the non-acceptance of winged monsters more personal than by presenting a character who refuses to accept his only son ? Stoicks rejection of his son matches the Vikings refusal to compromise when it comes to killing dragons . Unlike her and Casablanca above , the problem rests outside of the Main Character , yet its influence still affects us on a personal level . As Hiccup , we feel it . But this time , instead of my problem , its his problem . <p> Same thing happens in Back to the Future . What better way to juxtapose the trouble that happens when you try to prevent or avoid an unwanted future than by inserting a character who avoids conflict at all costs ?

The power of story lies in its ability to offer both subjective and objective views of the same problems . We simply ca n't experience that in real life . That is why stories eventually developed the four Throughlines and that is why we keep returning to them day after day . By showing us the ramifications of problem-solving in different contexts , stories gift us powerful insight to approaching and solving the problems in our own lives . <p> Dramatica is a theory of story that represents the next chapter in story development .

Assuming the story is whole and the Hero has grown ( a big assumption in an era when all Hollywood asks of its heroes is that they have a built-in audience , preferably the type that nurtures a fetish for spandex ) , the audience will interpret the difference between where the Hero ends and where they began as the adoption of some sort of knowledge . When Authors create a story they need not concentrate on developing something that is beyond their reign . <h> Heroes do NOT Have to Learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heroes who grow by learning and Heroes who grow by teaching . That article proved the purpose of story not to be to teach the central character something revelatory , but rather to argue that a particular way of solving a problem is either right or wrong . Offering an audience the chance to experience problem-solving and its results from within the eyes of this character and from without is the power of complete stories . It gives an Author the opportunity to argue their unique perspective in a way that ca n't exist in real life . <p> This is the power of great stories . <p> Authors should worry less about what the audience interprets from their story and more about making sure their message is as succinct and as clear as possible . Make sure that the character 's growth in approach moves with each act . Leave the interpretation--and notions of learning and teaching--to the Audience . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> In Dramatica , this growth that a Main Character undergoes , whether they are Change or Steadfast , appears as the Main Character Growth .

@@119273580 @8273580/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> The Story Goal <p> When looking for what a character wants , look to the Story Goal . Often seen as something to acquire , goals of attitude and psychology account for many a sophisticated narrative . Goals are something to acquire , but the nature of those goals can range from the physical to the mental and all spaces between . <p> April 29 , 2012 <h> Unlocking the Structural Code of the Story Goal <p> Stories that amble along needlessly often suffer from the lack of a clearly defined Goal . Without that drive towards resolution , a work of fiction can meander from one pointless scene to the next . Determining the source of difficulties guarantees clarity of purpose for any story . <p> In the article The True Champion of Chinatown , the Goal of the story was identified as Securing the Family History , with creepy tycoon Noah Cross ( John Huston ) at the helm . This rather wild notion runs counter to more popular understandings of the film . Many see Jake Gittes ( Jack Nicholson ) front and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family secret . This seems to be the most obvious understanding of the goal , yet as that article established , seeing Jake 's goal as the goal of concern to everyone fails to take into account the differential between the objective and subjective views of the story . Still , it does seem unusual to think of the Goal of that L.A. story in terms of Cross . <p> For that matter , how come in this analysis of How to Train Your Dragon the Goal was identified as Training the Next Generation of Dragon Killers ? Should n't it be to kill the big bad monster dragon ? And if the Goal of The Matrix is to take down the Matrix itself , why is n't the Goal of Star Wars to blow up the Death Star ? Are n't they the same story ? <p> The answer to all of these questions lies within a better appreciation of the true genesis of a story . <h> In the Beginning there was balance <p> Here is how it works : Before story , balance exists . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this serene scene , instantly creating an inequity . Sensing this new imbalance , our minds label the differential a problem and naturally begin the process of resolving that problem . <p> Problems do n't exist in a vacuum . In fact , problems ca n't be problems without solutions . Achieving the solution to the story 's inequity then becomes the Goal of the story . <p> Note that this Goal does not come attached to any one character . No one owns the Goal of a story , rather it attracts and repels everyone within . Some will be for it while others would rather the inequity persist . Some may even be responsible for starting the problem in the first place . Regardless , look not to individual wants and needs for the Goal of a story . Seek the initial inequity and work from there . <h> My kingdom for a solution ! <p> In Chinatown , problems begin when Hollis refuses to build the new dam , thus screwing up Noah 's plans for familial and urban reunification . Resolving that issue--an issue that affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white hat . <p> Likewise in The Matrix , Morpheus places his faith in Mr. Andersen , screwing up the nice little gig Agent Smith and his band of human harvesters had going on . Balance becomes imbalance and resolution takes center stage . The Goal that grows out of this desire for resolution--Dismantle the Matrix--did not stem from someone 's own personal wants or needs , but rather from the chasm of inequity created by that initial choice of simple Mr. Andersen . <p> In Star Wars , the imposing Empire overextends itself by boarding a diplomatic ship . In the past these overlords were simply annoying , now it seems they 've crossed the line . Would blowing up the Death Star really resolve this inequity ? Not really . The destruction of the Death Star only appears to be the Goal of the story because of the nature of Goals themselves . <h> When achieving the Goal is the Goal <p> Ask an Author the Goal of their story and they 'll naturally reply So and so needs to win the heart of his loved one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The copy girl needs to secure more clients . Goals of achievement are easiest to identify ( and thus easiest to write ) because Goals themselves are achievements . A problem enters the character 's lives and many of them set out to acquire the appropriate solution . That said , their motion towards this ending does not constitute what kind of resolution is needed . Do not confuse the particular type of a Goal with the concept of a Story Goal . The first defines the static nature of a structural point , the other defines the process undergone in getting there . <h> Goals of acquirement <p> So when it comes to a film like The Matrix , Dismantling the Matrix works as a natural Goal to resolve Morpheus ' faith in Neo . Not only is the Goal something to be achieved but it 's also about achieving . Think of this kind of goal as acquiring something or winning something or destroying something . The act of obtaining ( or freeing ) resolves the story 's imbalance . <p> Kung Fu Panda , Unforgiven , Casablanca--all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Kung Fu Panda troubles begin when disgruntled former student Tai Lung escapes from prison . Finding the True Dragon Warrior to defeat this new threat returns balance to all those involved . Same with Casablanca . Ugarte hands the Letters of Transit over to Rick and suddenly there is trouble for the great and noble Viktor Laszlo . Acquiring those Letters of Transit becomes the Goal of the Story , one that everyone shares concern with and one that naturally resolves the story 's difficulties . <p> Unforgiven ? Two cowpokes scar an innocent woman sparking a reward for revenge . Killing Anyone and Everyone Involved secures resolution for the inhabitants of Big Whiskey . Now , it does little to resolve the demons locked away in William Munny 's head ( in fact it has quite the opposite effect ) , but remember that the Goal of the Story is story-wide , it is not tied to the personal issues of any one character . It is objective and universal . <h> When Goals move beyond winning or losing <p> But what about Star Wars ? Surely this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad guys . But that 's just it--in the battle between Rebellion and Empire just being able to fight back works better than a particular instance of achievement . The doing becomes more important than the obtaining . <p> In future articles in this series on Story Goals we 'll take a look at more sophisticated resolutions similar to the one found in a galaxy far far away . Looking towards the initial inequity , we 'll determine the necessary solution and determine what kind of Goal would satisfy that drive to return things to a state of balance . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Dramatica refers to the Goal of a story as the Overall Story Goal . This is seen as separate ( yet tied thematically ) to the Main Character 's Concern or the Influence Character 's Concern , both which may be seen as goals in and of themselves . The Overall Story Goal resides wholly within the objective view of a story provided by the Overall Story Throughline . <p> The Overall Story Goal begins with the initial Story Driver or what many have previously referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of the Overall Story Solution , a thematic pair with the Overall Story Problem . <p> May 7 , 2012 <h> Achieving Story Goals that are Not Achievements <p> Far too often , Authors take what a Protagonist wants for granted . Acknowledging that this drive provides momentum for their narrative , they simply assign a task or reward for this character to work for . True freedom finds shape in the separation of the concept of the Story Goal from the Goal itself . <p> As covered in the article Unlocking the Structural Code of the Story Goal , the key towards identifying the main Story Goal rests in a firm grasp over when and where problems first start . While often mistakenly referred to as the Inciting Incident ( as it implies that this moment solely exists to " incite " the central character to action ) , this genesis of trouble begs for some sort of resolution . This reality of story structure gives fiction purpose , explains the motivations of the Protagonist , and can help aid writers who feel they are floundering about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your characters are really working for ? Look to the creation of inequity in their lives and establish the Goal needed to resolve it . <p> Goals in and of themselves are achievements , yet they do n't need to be about achievements . They can be--Stopping Corruption in L.A. Confidential , Securing the Inheritance in Rain Man , and Winning the Competition in Surf 's Up all provide excellent examples of how achieving itself can restore equity . But what about those stories that require a different kind of solution ? <h> Doing what needs to be done <p> In Star Wars the Empire boards a diplomatic ship , overextending their reach . The story that follows is n't so much about winning and losing as it is about dodging and striking ; the fight steals the center stage of purpose away from any specific prize or reward . Blowing up the Death Star works as a nice dividend for their efforts but works even better as an example of how to fight more effectively . Luckily , Luke had a nice little personal story running in parallel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dark Knight . Conflict did n't arise from any specific prize the Joker or Batman may have been vying for . Terror , and the manipulation of the response to it , became the central focus of the story 's thematic exploration . The Joker absconds with the mob 's life-savings leaving the good people of Gotham to find a way to protect their city from descending into chaos . Finding someone to focus their outrage on--in this case Batman himself - provided the final resolution needed to quell the unbridled terrorism . Unlike Luke though , it came at a great personal cost to Bruce Wayne . Again , as with the example of Unforgiven in the previous article , the Goal of a story purposefully sits apart from any personal issues the central character may have . <p> How about Covering Stillwater for Rolling Stone in Cameron Crowe 's Almost Famous ? Accomplishing this with the skill and expertise lost among those twice his age becomes job one for William once being denied backstage at the Black Sabbath concert . Encompassing more than simply issues personal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , this Goal of accurate and truthful coverage becomes of concern to everyone in the story . Penny Lane , Jeff Bebe , Lester Bangs--all of them work in concert towards that successful resolution . How well William does it becomes more important than whether or not he actually completes it . <h> Coming to a greater understanding <p> Shifting slightly from the difference between Goals of achieving and Goals of doing sit Goals of understanding . Although at first glance this may seem to be more internal in nature , this Goal of appreciation requires external effort . Consider the efforts to uncover what happened to LV-426 in Aliens . Losing contact with that colony starts the story 's central problem , propelling dock-loader Ripley , corporate stooge Burke and a handful of Space Marines into a brutal physical process . Escaping with the knowledge they find ( their greater understanding ) resolves that initial inequity and allows everyone to sleep a little better . <p> The Sixth Sense shares the same kind of dynamic . Problems begin when a troubled patient shoots his therapist before turning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and how possibly to keep it from happening again in young Cole becomes the Story Goal . As Protagonist in that story , Malcom the therapist pursues that greater knowledge . Now , he does have his own personal issues to contend with , but as far as Cole 's mom , friends and fellow students , doctors and various funeral attendees are all concerned understanding why Cole is the way he is resolves the story 's central problem . <p> How about something a little less scary ? In The Sound of Music problems begin with Maria 's decision to leave the convent . This rebellious act opens up a whole can of worms far beyond simply Maria 's personal issues of what she should do with her life--it opens up the Von Trapps to her wild influence . From tearing down drapes and wearing them as clothes to singing shamelessly amongst the Viennese hills , Maria threatens to destroy the precious Von Trapp family ... or unite it . How to make the Von Trapps whole again after the loss of their matriarch ? That resolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting everyone the understanding needed to solve a problem like Maria . <h> Learning something new <p> Along the same line of Goals of understanding , but different in nature just enough to warrant its own classification , lie Goals of learning . Again , this may seem as if it should occur within the minds of the characters but the process of gathering information is a physical act . Think of the efforts to assess the intentions of the Arab prince in Lawrence of Arabia . Beginning with the Arab Bureau 's decision to have their own man in the field , this film portrays the various attacks , executions , and massacres encountered on the road to further education . Learning how best to protect Britain 's interests in the region resolves and affirms Dryden 's initial decision by confirming the Empire 's drive to prosper . <p> Survival of a different sort , yet achieved in a dramatically similar fashion , finds life in Des Leben der Anderen ( The Lives of Others ) . Trouble starts with a Minister 's decision to " watch " famed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good friend of that very same playwright takes his own life . Convinced that resolution can only come in the dissemination of the current state of East German affairs , Dreyman sets out to publish his incendiary article . Dovetailing beautifully into this Story Goal , the personal throughline of the secret service man assigned to watch Dreyman provides the final keys to success in much the same way that Luke 's did in Star Wars . Information provides freedom . New information restores balance . <h> Goals of a different nature <p> Note that of all the examples given in this article and the one previous , the Goals in question are conspicuously all activities . Whether it be through obtaining something , doing something others ca n't , gaining a new understanding or struggling to learn something , each and every one of these Goals describes a physical activity . <p> But Goals can be so much more . <p> A failure of many a story paradigm persists in the notion that Goals must always be physical in nature . Whether it exists because most paradigms focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the fixation on the achieving nature of the Goal itself , these purveyors of mistaken assumptions fail to see all that a Story Goal can be . Overcoming prejudice ( as in To Kill a Mockingbird ) or convincing others that anyone truly can cook ( as in Ratatouille ) are just two examples of Story Goals that find definition far outside the comfortable realm of external activity . Both find resolution within rather than without , both equally as valid as any described above , yet both distinctly different in nature enough to call for further exploration . <p> But first , before venturing inside for potential story solutions , one must take into account a reality of the external world . Many a problem finds its genesis within the vicious activities of others , yet pressure can also bubble up from an untenable state-of-affairs . Changing these problematic situations becomes the focus of our next article . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> The Story Goals examined in this article all reside within the Dramatica 's Physics Domain ( or Activity Domain if you found the theory post-1998 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , this Domain contains the Types of Obtaining , Doing , Understanding and Learning .

Exposure to the example storyforms contained in the application along with articles like this one should help open up any Author to a greater world of complexity and subtlety of expression . <p> By definition , goals beg accomplishment . One either achieves success or loses to failure while attempting to reach a goal--a rather simple structural concept to grasp . Yet , the very nature of that goal evades such simplicity . <p> In the first and second articles of this series , goals born of problematic activities took center stage . Whether it was stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the East German suicide rate in The Lives of Others , resolution in those stories required some form of doing , obtaining , learning or understanding . Problematic activities brought forth goals of activity . <p> But what of stories where the simple act of doing is n't enough ? What of stories bred from a completely different kind of external problem ? <h> Problems and their solutions <p> What class of problem begins with the Inciting Incident of a story ? If the first major plot event sends things out of control , then stopping or ceasing those problematic activities becomes the purpose of the Protagonist .

While the characters were stuck in an untenable situation ( Civil War ) , what was needed for resolution from this out-of-control governing body was to find a way to fight back . The problem of major concern lied within the out-of-control actions of the Empire , not the Civil War itself . This is why resolution arrived at the end , even though both sides still existed . The Protagonist found a solution to the problem that began the story . An activity ( fighting more effectively ) resolved a problematic activity . <p> Same with The Matrix .

Joining the ranks of such films like Saving Private Ryan and Finding Nemo , Breaking Away provides an easy answer as to the question of the Story Goal , hinting at the eventual outcome .

No one moves forward until they can reach the goal of moving past their past . The singer 's decision to finally come clean with his wife and start anew wipes clean the slate of inequity . <h> The goal of things to come <p> In Braveheart , the good people of Scotland find themselves trapped under the rule of a cruel despotic King , Edward the Longshanks .

Sentenced to life , the banker disrupts the the stasis of prison life . Latching on to the hope and promise of a brighter future--something many of them gave up a long time ago--sits as the only Goal capable of reversing the inequity of unjust imprisonment . Made material in the form of Zihuatenjo , this new world represents the only way out for anyone--regardless of their own personal Shawshank--a chance to finally break free . <h> A move to the inside <p> Whether it be struggling to overcome a dark and heavy past , surviving in the present , fighting to shift momentum in the way things are changing , or developing and holding on to the promise of a brighter future , the characters in these stories face Earth-shattering situations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives and brings balance back to their worlds . <p> But there is another bond characters can sometimes find themselves faced with .

Like the bonds of slavery or imprisonment , the bonds of prejudice and of hatred can enslave characters just as well . In the next article , the focus will shift to these problems born of fixed mindsets and show how changing the situation within the minds of characters can also bring about resolution . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> The Dramatica theory of story breaks the Situation domain into 4 different Types : Past , Present , Progress , and Future . Different in shape and form from the problematic activities of the Physics domain , these kinds of problems exhibit static qualities . This is not to say that growth does not exist in these stories , only that the core problem at the center lies within a situation out-of-balance . Dislodging the stuck nature of a problematic situation becomes the Goal of a Protagonist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Uprooting the Fixed Mindset <p> When an Author considers what it is the Protagonist in their story wants they often conjure up a new country the characters can call their own , a treasure chest full of rare emeralds , or the hand of a beautiful girl . Whether it be better living conditions or fantastic riches , the focus almost always remains on the external world . Where else , after all , would you find something worthy of so much attention , something valuable enough to be labeled the Story Goal ? <p> Unfortunately , this assumption that all efforts tend towards what is out there blinds many an Author to another , sometimes more sophisticated purpose . <h> The trouble with immovable minds <p> Think of the kinds of problems one finds when Overcoming Difficult Situations . Surviving a Nazi concentration camp . Breaking free from small town life . Unjust lifelong imprisonment . Each one of these features characters hopelessly stuck . <p> Now imagine moving that fixed inequity inside the human mind and at once we witness a whole new realm of storytelling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Problems bred of the same fixed nature as an external situation , yet found deep within the human mind . Resolution here comes not in the form of crossing a finish line or proving innocence but rather in the form of a changed mindset . Popular within many a play , these stories pit opinions and ideologies against one another , the solution falling into the ability to unstuck deep-rooted attitudes . <h> Remembering to resolve <p> In Stephen King 's novella Apt Pupil ( NOT the film ) , an evil man has been forgotten . This potential explodes into conflict the moment a young teenage boy endeavors to blackmail the aging Nazi . Reviving this evil--the drive of the Protagonist in this twisted story--requires both remembering who this old man is and what he does . By forcing a recount of despicable deeds , the boy succeeds in securing his own place in history , ending it all with his own play for the memories of those families devastated by evil . <p> On a much lighter note , the same Story Goal of remembering can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins when Dr. Frederick Frankenstein ( pronounced " Fronk-en-steen " ) learns that he has inherited his family 's estate in Transylvania . Although embarrassed by his familial association with the mad scientist Frankenstein , the young doctor finds himself intrigued by his ancestor 's work and begins slowly reviving the memory of the monster maker . The townspeople , rigid in their opinion towards scientists both mad and potentially mad , grow increasingly worried about the continued research . Only by properly pronouncing his family name--and thereby reclaiming his heritage--does the doctor finally find a way to resolve the issues in the story . <p> Misplaced opinions and trouble-some preconceptions . Regardless of the problematic attitude , these stories both find resolution in the acquirement ( or achievement ) of a memory . <h> Struggling against impulse <p> In Bruges pits hit man against hit man with the unspoken code of their profession : " Kill a kid , pay a price " . Beginning with one professional breaking that very same code , the story brings the characters into conflict over the lack of hesitation--a conflict that eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured in this series on Story Goals , In Bruges provides the first example of what happens when characters ca n't find resolution . The drive to achieve the Story Goal does not always end in success . The presupposition of a happy ending runs counter to the reality of Meaningful Endings . Sometimes the solution arrives , other times it lies dormant . <p> The professional killers of In Bruges fail to overcome their fixed attitudes , they fail to control their impulses . Here the problem of the story overwhelms any potential solution leaving the inequity intact well beyond the curtain drop . <p> Contrast this failure with the successful resolution found in the " Self-Esteem " episode of the television series My So Called Life . Exploring the prejudice present within hallowed high school hallways , this story grants relief to teenage crush with an act of naked exposure . In front of all , and in complete disregard of established caste systems , cool boy asks wallflower girl to date and the girl accepts--without hesitation-- " Sure . " Supplanting the urge to run and hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> When the dream becomes the conflict <p> Love also seems to be on the minds of everyone in When Harry Met Sally . Starting with their decision to share a ride to New York , both Harry and Sally and everyone around them clash over their different attitudes towards finding a partner for life . Love--romantic love--takes the Story Goal position here and waits patiently for one or the other to choose their heart over their head . Changing one 's opinion towards love eventually resolves the problems in the story . <p> The same relationship between inequity and Goal awaits in George Cukor 's classic The Philadelphia Story . Problems begin when a wealthy socialite decides to marry nouvea riche , bringing to light issues of prejudice , pretension and all-around haughty bad attitudes . Class warfare in the search of relief . Release comes with a gesture of love , a promise to marry and the introduction of true deep happiness . <p> In both stories , the fulfillment of desire secures peace of mind for those brought into conflict over differing mindsets . <h> Refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know their differing mindsets to be the culprit , yet still refuse to entertain the alternative ? Check out Sydney Pollack 's 12 Angry Men for a great example of a conflict of contemplation . Bias tips the scales once one of twelve jurors decides to run counter to popular opinion , declaring the defendant not guilty . The deliberations , both quiet and impassioned , that develop over the course of the story beg for the remaining unconvinced to simply contemplate the idea of innocence . The moment consideration supplants prejudice , solution trumps problem and balance returns . <h> A means to express conflict <p> Note how many of these examples come from plays or are movies based on plays . The mind story finds greater mobility in a medium that more readily portrays the thoughts and attitudes of characters in conflict . The literary gateway present in novels and plays provides fertile ground for this type of dramatic exploration , yet should n't be seen as an excuse to discount its potential on the silver screen . Ambitious Authors may recognize an opportunity to present a unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Free your mind <p> Regardless of the type of internal conflict--a refusal to remember , a compulsion to act first and think later , an unfulfilled desire or a conscious decision to think for one 's self--the solution always rests in ousting a fixed attitude . Free the mind from bias and equity will return . Leave it stuck and the desired resolution will remain a lost Goal . <p> But what of the internal struggle to simply formulate an attitude ? <p> On the path to opinion lies the process of thinking , the process of developing ideas and the process of providing the fertile ground from which they can grow . Like the problems of external activities found in the article Achieving Story Goals that are Not Achievements , the problems of internal activities create their own unique issues , thus requiring completely different Story Goals as of yet not discussed in this series .

They may be strong , they may have the right moves , and they may have the right attitude , but when it comes to solving their problems something inside of them simply does n't work right . <p> Stories featuring these characters find their structural problems firmly rooted in the way these characters think . Unlike the problems of fixed attitudes found in the previous article Uprooting the Fixed Mindset , these problems exist in motion . They defy stasis , preferring to incur their injury by jumbling up the process of one neuron firing to the next . <h> Think better <p> When the way people formulate their thoughts becomes the impetus for strife , the only way out becomes to manipulate or re-work that inner process .

Cut-off and forced to live a life they certainly were n't born for , the Supers do their best to fit in . They do n't look towards taking down Syndrome--or any other villain for that matter--because they understand that such an act would not resolve the issue at hand . This is n't The Matrix .

Here , turn-of-the-century London hosts discord between the classes when a phoneticist claims he can turn a Cockney flower girl into a princess . Once the girl initially agrees to the scheme , the events that follow work in service towards completing that goal of putting on the ultimate show . The finish line of the story consists of this girl pretending , or appearing , to be something more than she is . Once the Hungarian phonetician buys the act hook line and sinker , the problems at-large cease and the film 's logical storyline comes to an end ( " You Did It " ) . The emotional throughlines still need wrapping up , but as far as the larger problem goes the young flower girl made a convincing transformation . <p> In both stories , acting became the focal point for Protagonist and friends .

Beyond simply differences of opinion , problems in this Merchant-Ivory film stem from how people process their thoughts . In that respect , the only path to resolution lies in young Lucy reorganizing her own internal process . She does this by truly realizing her full potential . <p> Note the difference between this and the family of Supers above " living up " to their potential . The comic book heroes already had what they needed within , they simply needed an opportunity to act that way . Lucy , on the other hand , and participants in stories like hers , needs to become something much more than she already is . Her essence must change . Beginning with Mr. Emerson 's brash decision to switch rooms and ending with Lucy 's final decision to stop denying true feelings , the young girl 's final transformation resolves the problem at hand and brings the story to a close . <p> An Officer and a Gentleman takes a similar look at psychological rearrangement . In this story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School creates problems that can only be solved by a complete transformation of character . Satellite players manipulate and coerce--some in an effort to get candidates to drop-out , others in order to tragically marry . And while considerable bouts of physicality highlight the film 's events , the rigors of psychological training dominate the dramatic battlefield . The decision to show for graduation completes the metamorphosis of character , made apparent with a gesture unseen in more common ceremonies . <p> In both cases , the transformation of the central character operates as more than simply an act of character growth and more as a focal point of purpose the cast aspires to . <h> The goal of the new <p> In the world of Ratatouille balance shifts when an aspiring rodent separates from his family . Finding opportunity within the walls of a failing Parisian restaurant , the young upstart sets out to convince others to think different . Hijinx and hilarity ensue , yet it is the inability of everyone to accept the idea that anyone can cook that stokes the oven of conflict . The harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverses this trend , restoring balance to their world through a gentle act of acceptance . <p> Aspiration also sets the stage for conflict in Working Girl . A working-class secretary 's decision to insult her boss grants entry into the treacherous world of mergers and acquisitions . Here , the lure of a new idea makes backstabbing and dishonest manipulation commonplace . It also provides a glimpse as to what is needed to succeed , a glimpse at the goal of the story . For one to climb the corporate ladder one must engage in psychological combat not needed on the battlefields of Braveheart or Lawrence of Arabia . Resolution arrives with the secretary 's explanation of how she conceived of buying into radio , the ensuing shift of power signifying a successful accomplishment of the story 's goal . <p> Regardless of the cast 's physical composition--digital or analog--the structure of stories built around the need for a new idea operates the same . <h> The goal of a new vision <p> But what of stories where the simple introduction of a new idea is n't enough ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all together ? <p> A daughter 's decision to move out brings quiet turmoil to a Chinese family in Eat , Drink , Man , Woman . Upsetting the tender balance of father and three gives rise to the central dramatic question of the story : How can they keep the family together when they no longer share the same physical space ? This inquiry ignites the search for a solution , its answer claiming the spot of story goal . One by one as the family fractures evermore , the hope of success continues to diminish until at long last the father acquiesces to his daughter 's new role as patriarch . A new concept of family gives a satisfactory response to that burning dramatic question and restores peace to those beset by it . <p> A little louder , yet no less functional ( at least story wise ) , sits the Farrely brothers ' There 's Something About Mary .

Lying , cheating and stalking sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coercing their way into Mary 's heart . The goal for all ? To somehow convince Mary to imagine life with them and them alone . Her final choice brings closure to the contest and relief to tear-stained faces . <h> Wrap-up <p> Story goals of psychology chart unfamiliar territory to many an Author . How much easier is it for one to think of something tangible or worldly for their Protagonist to aspire to ? Yet , the goals of invention and conception inhabit our everyday lives , as much , or even more so , than our efforts to gain or secure Earthly treasures . So too do the goals of being a certain way and of becoming something brand new , these last two groups complementing the first two in a way that offers a full exploration of solving through better thinking . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Dramatica categorizes these four areas of exploration under the Domain of Psychology . The Goals of Being , Becoming , Conceiving , and Conceptualizing find a home within this corner of the structural chart . Later versions of the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Nature , Conceiving an Idea , and Developing a Plan . These replacement terms may offer easier comprehension , yet do so at the cost of accuracy .

The usual " I do n't  like to be told what to do " defense masking for a failure to truly investigate the complex concepts of the theory . You know you 're in trouble when Aristotles Poetics is sighted as a superior text . <h> What Dramatica Sees <p> Dramatica is an incomplete model of the narrative form . The model makes the assumption problems can be and are meant to be solved . <p> This is half-true . Yes , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem . Whether or not that problem is actually solved , however , is determined by the storys dynamics . Some problems are solved ( as in Mad Max : Fury Road , Lord of the Flies and Romeo and Juliet ) , others are not ( Rain Man , To Kill a Mockingbird , and Hamlet ) . <p> That is but one narrative type other types include puzzle , revelation , the joke , and a non-story story type he labels " plotless , " though such stories are not plotless , only their structural features are experimental and unconventional , making them challenging to comprehend . <p> We could quibble over the meaning of plot , but yesif your purpose in writing a story is to write something challenging to comprehend , then Dramatica theory is not for you . Dramatica helps writers communicate meaning to audience with clarity and purpose . Experimental narrative types , like those sampled in films like Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life , are best left to other understandings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dramatica Theory also assumes name spaces which are mere deviations , derivative , that is , of ancient labels and concepts . " Impact character , " for example , is derived from an older theory , unnamed , from " influence character . " <p> Not sure why this is a bad thing . New terminology needed to be created in order to more accurately describe the forces and points-of-view present in a complete story . As for the last bit , citing unnamed sources is a difficult tactic to counter . <p> An influence character influences a narratives action , positively or negatively , or both , and is not limited to personas , could be setting features and objects as well as events . <p> This is beginning to look like an argument of semanticsone of the prime reasons for Dramaticas newly imagined and " rebranded " definitions . Old definitions are vague and deficient and require updating if any progress is to be made in our collective understanding of story . <p> An Influence Character , by Dramaticas definition is that character , or more accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their personal problems . This point-of-view can not be held within a feature or object or even an event as one of its primary features is the ability to change over time ( Act by Act ) . The Influence Characters point-of-view must be able to shift in order to better challenge the Main Characters further avoidance of his or her own personal issues . <p> So no , the Influence Character of a story can not be a mountain , a lake or a rock . It needs to have a point-of-view . <p> It is apparent this person is confusing Antagonist for Influence Character . An Antagonist , by Dramaticas clear definition , is an objective character rolea functionwhose sole purpose is to prevent the Protagonist from achieving the Goal of the story . The Influence Character is a point-of-view whose purpose is to challenge the Main Characters personal issues . Sometimes these two can be found in the same player ( as with the Joker in The Dark Knight ) but usually are found in separate players ( Ben Kenobi is the Influence Character in Star Wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Influence Character in To Kill a Mockingbird , Bob Ewell is the Antagonist ) . <p> Here you can see the reason for new terminology . Reading the original post one gets the idea that the contributor lacks focus in the concepts he or she presents . Definitions are all over the place and seemed to be jumbled up with competing contexts of narrative . This may explain the hostility towards Dramatica as the theorys purpose is to bring clarity and greater understanding to narrative , not continue the confusion proffered for centuries . <h> The Difference between Objective and Subjective <p> Two other character types contained therein are objective and subjective characters . " Objective character " describes an observer persona , though " objective " is also a type of attitude : a shared unbiased value and belief perspective . " Subjective character " is an observed subject persona , though likewise is also a type of attitude : a personal , subject-to-bias value and belief perspective . <p> Here the author stamps his own erroneous interpretation onto Dramaticas elegant concepts . As mentioned previously , Dramatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Characters . Objective because we stand back and look at them removed from the conflict ; we do n't  assume their position . These two only represent a small fraction of the total amount of Objective Characters one may find in a story , yet they are the most important . The Antagonist and Protagonist represent the drive towards resolving and not resolving a storys central problem . <p> The Subjective Characters differ from the Objective Characters because of their ability to grow and shift their point-of-view during a story . The Protagonist of a story will always pursue the Goal ; the Main Character may eventually change how they see the world . In Star Wars , Luke the Protagonist never ceased finding a way to fight the empire ; Luke the Main Character eventually learned to stop testing himself all the time and instead , trust in something outside of himself . This dichotomy helps provide the meaning of a story . <p> Also , objective , subjective , and influence characters are not per se fixed for those roles , any can be another at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at the same time . <p> True , the point-of-view of the Influence Character may be handed off to different players as it is with the Ghosts in A Christmas Carol , but to think this appropriate for all story points sets an Author up for disaster . <p> This is where Dramatica shines as a powerful tool . By running counter to this popular notion that everything is everything and meaning constantly shifts , Dramatica helps a writer focus the intent of their story . Context creates meaning , if that meaning is constantly shifting then the end result is a meaningless mess . <p> Audiences crave a consistency of purpose . <h> Why the Old No Longer Works <p> The most ancient term for the functions of an influence or impact character is agonist , to mean a contestant that shapes the action such that the agency of a character or setting or event is transformatively influential . Antagonism is at least two forces in congruent opposition such that they are both unequivocally and irrevocably transformed by their direct and indirect interactions . <p> A prime example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Influence Character . This is why old outdated understandings of story serve only to confuse and destroy coherent and moving narrative . Modern precise terminology , like that found within Dramatica , grants greater clarity and sophistication of purpose . Mashing two clearly separate narrative concepts into one diminishes the power of both . <p> This same mistake happens when you find those convinced Protagonist and Main Character are one and the same . They often are , but they do n't  always have to be . Andy is the Protagonist in The Shawshank Redemption ( the one trying to escape the system ) , but Red is the Main Character ( the institutionalized man whose point-of-view we assume ) . Furiosa is the Protagonist of Mad Max : Fury Road ( the one trying to run away ) , yet it is Max himself who we become personally involved with ( we know what goes on inside his head , we never find out what is going on inside hers ) . And finally , Atticus is the Protagonist of To Kill a Mockingbird ( the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story . Atticus fights against prejudice while we as Scout do n't  even realize were prejudice ourselves to the boogeyman across the street . <p> A clear understanding makes these kinds of sophisticated stories possible for everyone . <h> What ? <p> Dramatica Theory painfully subverts and misses entirely essential implication appeals the artfully implied intangible action of moral human condition struggles and crises , which is the more significant and appealing overall feature of a narrative : what a narrative is actually about . The tangible action is mere package for the moral human condition appeal and invariably superficial . <p> I confess I have no idea what any of this means , but it sounds like a vain attempt to discount Dramatica with nonsense . <p> Update : Chris Huntley , co-creator of Dramatica , offered an explanation after reading this article : <p> I think the part that you did n't  quite understand is about the values espoused about a storys subject matter the real world contextual meaning expressed through story encoding rather than the part that Dramatica provides , which is the framework that provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subjectively , linearly and holistically , in an effort to provide a meaningful narrative about the subject matter . In other words , the author chooses that she wants to say about a subject matter , but she uses Dramatica to provide a comprehensive and understandable framework to argue the point using the narrative form . - For example , I may think that throwing battery acid on dogs is despicable , but Dramatica let 's me make a case for WHY it is despicable , and perhaps even points out contexts in which it may not be despicable in order to make the point better . <p> I have a tendency to assume that everyone is open enough to take the time to really understand what Dramatica is all about and what it offers to story . Thankfully , Chris has explained it enough times to people who do n't  that he recognized what was being discussed here . Hope his update clears things up about what Dramatica is , and what it is n't . <h> Storyform vs . Storytelling <p> Yes ! But only insofar as it explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching the ingredients of story ; its up to the Author to combine them into a memorable and lasting meal . <p> A structure is the skeleton and is troublesome if exposed . The flesh , so to speak , is the meat of the matter and , though dramatic structure ( plot ) is pertinent and near universal of shape , is not a universal shape and can only fundamentally be defined as the moral human condition , which approaches infinite . They say beauty is only skin deep and ugly goes all the way to the bone ; artful narrative goes inside the bone , too , and naturally and appealingly , artfully , sublimely , beautifully drapes the skeletal structure . <p> This sounds wonderful . What the Author is describing is what Dramatica refers to as the second stage of narrative communication : Storytelling ( or Story Encoding ) . The first stage , or Storyforming process , is the stage the Dramatica Theory focuses on . The Storyform is indeed the skeletal structure of a story and is not the kind of thing any reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell everyone I have ever taught or consult with , you do n't  get points for writing the perfect Dramatica story . The theory is there to help writers strengthen their communication skills and to effectively balance their story with a holistic understanding of the issues at hand . Its not a form of narrative unto itself . <p> Finally , something we can agree on . <h> Common Ground <p> Dramatica Theory best practice may be appreciated as yet another emphasis on structure that accesses fundamentals , that asserts structure matters and is a part of a well-crafted narrative . The structure itself has n't  changed since the first story ever told , only the names and principles and theories and values and beliefs have been variably enumerated over time , and are adaptive and adoptive to an eras culture and technology , and even , yes , language sciences and arts . <p> And I agree with this as well , though I would say that Dramaticas new terminology and most importantly , its concept of the Four Throughlines , elevates it beyond anything that has come before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Other writers chimed in : <p> a quick look at the Dramatica website , and the focus seems to be screenplays . <p> True , but that 's only because of the time required to analyze a film compared to the time necessary to accurately analyze a novel . We focus on film because that is where our passion lies . That does not discount the theorys ability to better understand narrative in alternate forms . <p> Story is story regardless of medium and you can find coherent complete storyforms in plays as well as novels . The aforementioned To Kill a Mockingbird joins Lord of the Flies , Sula , Washington Square and Pride and Prejudice round out Dramaticas collection of novel analyses . Romeo and Juliet , Hamlet , Othello and Ibsens A Dolls House offer a collection of play analyses . <p> One clarification which should make this easier to understand : a work can have more than one Storyform . Like the Sports Storyform and Romance Storyform found in Jerry Maguire , The Lord of the Rings contains many many different storyforms : Frodo and Samwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Anytime you find two characters with competing points of view that grow over time and challenge each other , you will find a new Storyform . Most films only have time to explore one Storyform , the novel affords a great many more . Though you 'll note that the truly great novels only focus on one ( Mockingbird and All The Light We Can not See working as two wonderful examples ) . <h> More than Spin <p> Well , I clicked on the link , started reading the blurb about how much of a paradigm shift Dramatica is and promptly closed the page . To me it appears as a classic case of what the boffins and spin-meisters call re-branding . Let 's use all the same literary constructs but update them so they 're hip and sound flash , right Dude ? I 'd rather study Aristotle , Freytag , and Egri , just to name a couple . <p> While Egri identified the two principal characters within story he failed to recognize the most important aspect of them : that one changes their resolve while the other remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards providing the meaning of the story to the Audience . <p> Dramatica is more than rebranding , more than name deviation . It is a comprehensive understanding of story without caveat and without exception . Its foundation of the Four Throughlines found in every complete story and its assertion that not every Protagonist is a Main Character clearly delineates it from everything that came before . Take the time to truly understand what it is saying before you discount it ; you might find something worthy of applying to your own work .

In some contexts ( family films ) this approach might seem helpful . Within all stories , regardless of genre or intended audience , thinking in terms of the Main Character 's final resolve offers greater accuracy . This concept of story structure applies to any story or piece of fiction that intends a deeper meaning . <p> The problem is that the converse is not always true . Change Main Characters do not always learn something ( Ed Exley in L.A. Confidential , William Munny in Unforgiven ) . And Steadfast Main Characters do not always teach ( Randy the Ram in The Wrestler , Mr. Incredible in The Incredibles ) . As usual , the objectivity of Dramatica encompasses all fiction by providing a solid touch point from which to build a story .

Creatives everywhere have long respected the studios ability to fuse heart and soul into enduring classics of narrative . How is it then that Pixar apparently has no idea how they do what they do ? <p> Last summer , Pixar story artist Emma Coats tweeted a list of 22 story " rules " she learned while working there . Retweeted and passed around ad-nauseam , many took to the list in the hopes of discovering the secrets to the studios long time success . Unfortunately , what they found were mostly superficial tips to help writers during the process of writingnot necessarily the reason why Pixars film excel over all others . <p> To be fair , these rules were originally presented as " tweets " and thus were constricted by the 140 character limit . Nothing much of value can be presented in such a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as great insight into the construction of a Pixar-like story . <p> The real secret , it turns out , can be found elsewhere . <h> The Not-So Helpful <p> First up , the bad : <p> Rule 3 : Trying for theme is important , but you wo n't see what the story is actually about til you 're at the end of it . Now rewrite . <p> Another call to simply trust the processwoefully turning a blind eye to meaningless writing in the hopes that it will all somehow " magically " work out . Creative writing certainly requires a fair amount of exploration , but the sooner you know what it is you want to say the sooner you can actually go about writing what it is you want to say . The danger , of course , lies in beginning production before that themeor purposehas made itself known . Cramming it in last minute requires multiple re-dos and countless hours of overtime . <p> Rule 4 : Once upon a time there was . Every day , . One day . Because of that , . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for writing a tale ? No thanks . If one wanted to put out a statement ( which is all a tale really is ) then one could use Twitter or a Facebook update . Stories argue , tales state . Unfortunately the tip above usually leads to the latter . <p> The balance of the less-than-helpful tips lie somewhere between simple writing advice and the kind of feel-good hand-holding typical of a weekend writers retreat in Sedona . " You have to know yourself " , " You got ta identify with your situation/characters " , and " Let go even if its not perfect " do not really reveal the reason why so many of Pixar films remain beloved in the hearts of millions let alone how to construct one of your own . When you 're stuck , make a list of what WOULDNT happen next " and Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind work as great brainstorming techniques but they do n't  expose any meaningful secret approach . If it is really true that " those who ca n't do , teach " then the corollary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach . " <h> Extracting the Gems <p> That said , some of these rules provide useful concrete information that many can actually use to structure a meaningful story worthy of the Pixar name . Some of these actually explain why their films work so well . The first that stands out : <p> Rule 16 : What are the stakes ? Give us reason to root for the character . What happens if they do n't succeed ? Stack the odds against . <p> Dramatica ( Narrative Science theory ) refers to these stakes as the Story Consequences . Most writers understand the concept of Goals and how they motivate characters to take action , but relatively few understand the importance of providing their characters consequences should they fail . Both exist in a story and both require each other for meaning . In Toy Story , failure to keep up with the move condemns the toys to a life of perpetual panic . Consequences work as a motivator to help propel a story forwarda solid tip that gives a foundation for good strong narrative . <p> Rule 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Throw the polar opposite at them . Challenge them . How do they deal ? <p> Very helpful . If one wishes to write a story about the first African-American baseball player and all the issues of preconception that run along with such a predicament , throwing his " polar opposite " against him would help increase the conflict and give him reason to grow . But what would that opposite be ? Someone who does n't  believe he should be playing ball because of the color of his skin ? That would challenge him , but it would n't really challenge his own personal point-of-view as he would have been dealing with that his entire life already . Better to throw someone in there who shares a similar predicament but goes about solving it in a different and " opposite " way . <p> Thankfully the current model of Dramatica provides us with clues where to find this similar , yet different character through its concept of Dynamic Pairs . Pursuit and Avoid , Faith and Disbelief , Perception and Actuality all work as dynamic opposites to each otherput @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sparks fly . <p> In the case of our famed baseball player we would want to construct an Influence Character that was deep in denial . Perhaps an aged coach well beyond his years , obsessed with bringing a losing team to the World Series . Or maybe the baseball players wife who , regardless of all the talk of extra-martial affairs and excessive drinking on the part of her husband , stands by his side through thick and thin . Either way , this dynamically " opposite " character would force the baseball player to examine his own issues of prejudice and preconception and whether or not he was living in denial . <p> So yes , challenging characters to deal with their issues by providing " polar opposites " certainly helps in the construction of a story . Again , concrete , solid advice that can help one write a powerful story of their own . <p> Rule 7 : Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle . Seriously . Endings are hard , get yours working up front . <p> Another good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #3 above . Should writers go with the flow or are they supposed to know where they 're going ? A meaningful ending bases itself on the thematic arguments that preceded them . They work together to help define the Authors argument . Which brings us to <p> Rule 14 : Why must you tell THIS story ? What 's the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of ? That 's the heart of it . <p> The argument an Author makes runs tantamount to all . The " belief burning within you " lies in the Authors point-of-view on how to solve a particular problem . Narrative Science helps to give those beliefs a reference point and offers suggestions for formatting a strong and coherent argument to support that belief . <h> Genius Defined <p> While fun to retweet and pass along , the majority of these 22 rules of Pixar storytelling do little to explain the rampant success of that studio during their first decade . If it is true that these were gleaned from " senior colleagues " then it is quite possible that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really able to get there in the first place . <p> The real secret to Pixars undeniable success lies in their ability to write complete stories . Whether it be the dynamic clash between Woody and Buzz in the first Toy Story or the thematic interplay between Linguini and Remy in Ratatouille , each and every story effectively argued a specific approach to solving a problem . Managing to incorporate all four throughlines necessary to convey this message over a decade of production astounds those who managed to only do so maybe once every ten years . Pick any film and one can easily identify the Overall Story Throughline , the Main Character Throughline , the Influence Character Throughline and the Relationship Story Throughline . Other studios and other films can usually only claim to be able to do the first two ( though some even struggle with that ) . Finding Nemo went so far as to weave a second smaller , yet no less important , sub-story into the final product . A truly remarkable accomplishment that bears full witness . <p> For the genius to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of how narrative works to argue an approach to problem-solving becomes necessary . Narrative Science theory , and Dramatica in particular , provides that insight . It provides the secret " keys " everyone hoped to find when they first stumble across these 22 rules of storytelling . Understanding why so many of their films appeal to both the hearts and minds of countless millions can go a long way towards insuring the same kind of love and acceptance in ones own work .

Frustration sets in the moment one hears the trope thrown about with so much familiarity from accomplished screenwriters .

If the original Periodic Table of Elments illuminated the chemical makeup of gasses and solids in our Universe , then surely this Table of Storytelling Elements must she 'd the same light on narrative . Yet this chart says nothing of the true chemical composition of story . It says nothing of how to craft an argument with a mix of character , plot , theme and genre .

By pretending to grant wisdom , the trope deceives the writer.2 <h> The Young and the Lesbian <p> the leader is a person younger than all the rest , maybe even a kid . This usually shows that the young leader is smarter than his or her adult lackies , or that some manner of higher authority ( usually their powerful parents ) has placed them in charge . In any case , this usually makes for an interesting character dynamic . <p> Ok . So now that I know that having a kid in charge is " interesting " , how does that help me write my story ?

We 've said nothing of the true dramatic potential at the center of his position , yet somehow we come away with this feeling that we understand something profound about our charactersomething that ties him into a long history of similar characters before him .

These are questions writers should be asking , questions that leads to a better understanding of the purpose behind the words on the page , questions that call upon structural elements to support that conclusion . Not questions about schoolgirl lesbians that can only lead to answers like this : <p> Difficult to say . It sounds to me like there 's a huge amount of overlap with Romantic Two-Girl Friendship , but that page specifically says that if the relationship is " explicit " then it falls under " Schoolgirl Lesbians " .

Romeo and Juliet and West Side Story may share the same storyform , yet they differ in their storytelling . Turning to examples of storytelling when in the development of a narrative leads to emulation , not understanding . It may not be dull and uninteresting , but the natural progression of a trope leans towards cultural clichT . The subject of a narrative takes precedence over the substance . <h> The Cancer of Cynicism <p> Tropes . A misunderstanding masquerading as insightinsight that spawns destructive memes like " Everything is a Remix " .

Relating the story of American POWs dealing with a traitor in their midst , the film manages to tell an effective and complete narrative as evidenced by the solid storyform we found . <p> The most interesting aspect of the analysis1 was the collective " group " Main Character Throughline . At first , some considered Sgt. J.J. Sefton ( William Holden ) the Main Character . He is , after all , the only one we truly seem to care about . <p> Most think of Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ) as the Main Character since we see him first and root for his escape . But really , we are never truly Andy for the most of the film he is up to something we do n't  find out about until much later . Instead , we look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact many of the POV shots in that film are from Reds perspective . <p> The same happens in Stalag 17 . While there is that moment at the end where we witness Prices conversation with Sgt. Schulz ( Peter Graves and Sig Ruman ) , many more moments exist where we hear about what Sefton is up to and only learn the truth after the fact . Take for instance the scene where Sefton is off with the female Russian POWs . If Sefton was in fact the Main Character we would have been there with him , experiencing Cossack hospitality along with him . <p> It is clear then that the men in barracks 4 , led primarily by the always angry Duke ( Neville Brand ) , represents our way into the story . The narration by Cookie ( Gil Stratton ) while not always the sign of a Main Characteronly serves to add more weight to this argument . <p> From there it was a simple matter of nailing down the Throughlines and the deep thematics issues and problems at the heart of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool , aloof , **27;544;TOOLONG attitude is the exact thing that challenges the group to reconsider who they think is behind it all . And the Relationship Story Throughline Problem of Evaluation and eventual Solution of Reevaluation perfectly encapsulates the relationship between Sefton and the other men . They think him guilty in the beginning and then reevaluate his status as potential war hero in the end . This last notion also services nicely as an example of the Main Character Solution of Potentiality . <p> Finally , when Dramatica predicts an Influence Character Unique Ability and Influence Character Critical Flaw that so closely matches the original film that you could have sworn the program actually wrote the screenplay , you ca n't help but think this is the right storyform.2 The Influence Characters Unique Ability is the unique quality of that character to influence the Main Character to change his or her point-of-view . The storyform we landed on predicted Appraisal for his Unique Ability , and this matches up with what you will find in the film . Sefton always has something to say about someone that sets him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the arrival of Lt. Dunbar ( Don Taylor ) , Sefton is the first to call him out on his silver spoon pedigree . <p> But it is the Influence Character Critical Flaw that Dramatica calls out that really steals the show . The theory predicted Repulsion to be the quality of character that lessens Seftons ability to influence the men to change their mind about him . And that pretty much describes Sefton through and through . He is a repulsive personsomeone who constantly pushes people away and refuses to get close to any of them . As soon as we saw that element in play , we knew we had the right storyform . <p> Deciphering the storyform for a particular work and seeing all the pieces fall into place is a fun and gratifying experience . It is like being able to read the codex of our interactions with one anotheralmost like Neo and his ability to see the the Matrix .

This accuracy develops a level of trust unheard of in other competing paradigms or schools of thought . In a recent QnA with Dramatica co-creator Chris Huntley , the common concept of conflict gets a thorough evaluation : <p> Conflict is the product of effort to resolve an inequity as it meets resistance . We look for conflict as we attempt to identify an inequity 's source(s) . If we neglect to look in all the possible places conflict can exist , we open ourselves ( and the story ) to missing the entirety of the conflict and a true understanding of the inequity , leaving the real likelihood of failing to resolve the inequity thoroughly .

First person , third person , first person plural and third person plural . I , You , We and They . As explained in more detail within the article Writing Complete Stories , these four contexts have found their way into stories via the Main Character ( I ) , the Influence Character ( You ) , the Relationship Story ( We ) , and the Overall Story ( They ) Throughlines . <p> Hearing this for the first time , one might think Well , that seems right , but I 'm not sure ... Rest assured , there is a reason why these four throughlines appear in complete stories . <p> Ever heard the idea that " One man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter .

Think of a problem and it MUST fall into one of these categories . Racism ? That 's a fixed attitude . Unjustly accused of killing your wife ? That 's a situation . Wiping out an alien race ?

Any combination is acceptable save for one rule : the Main Character and Influence Character Domains must be diagonally opposed to each other . Why ? <p> If the Main Character 's problems lie in a Situation and the Influence Character creates problems because of their Fixed Attitude , well then you have enough of a similarity between the two that growth can occur . A Situation describes something externally stuck . A Fixed Attitude describes something internally stuck . Both are static ( " You and I are both alike . " ) The line of dialogue that usually follows , " We are nothing alike " occurs because , while they both describe something fixed , one is external and one is internal . They are not completely alike . <p> This occurs in the animated film How to Train Your Dragon . Hiccup , the Main Character , finds personal trouble in his physicality , or Situation . He is a 98lb. weakling in a tribe of manly Vikings . " You just pointed to all of me , " refers to those issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father Stoick assumes the role of Influence Character . Using the above rule from Dramatica , the Influence Character must be in a diagonally opposed relationship to the Main Character on the structural chart . This puts Stoick in Fixed Attitude and helps define the kind of impact he 'll have on Hiccup . <p> Stoick . Stoic . Even his name confirms the placement ! <p> Interestingly enough , later on in the film Hiccup has the " He and I are both alike " moment , but uses it to describe his relationship with Toothless , not his father . While it helps explain Hiccup 's motivation for freeing the beast , its use outside of the norm tends to suggest that there should be even more exploration of their relationship beyond simply dragging sticks in the sand . It implies that there is still growth to be had in the relationship between them , when at that time their relationships was already rock solid . <h> Genre as a Tool <p> Dramatica considers this personality level of story structure--the Domain level--to be the most accurate and productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake Snyder and John Truby think of Genre in terms like Thrillers , Romantic Comedies and War Dramas . But beyond a handy shopping list of storytelling patterns , how truly helpful are these concepts in determining the scope of what it is an Author is trying to say ? How helpful are they in balancing the story 's points of view ? At best they identify the patterns . They never answer the question why ? <p> Everyone agrees that a story must have conflict . And while everyone also recognizes the necessity of seeing all sides of an argument , only one theory of story needs it for meaning . Dramatica moves beyond this reality by helping an Author build solid concrete arguments . With Dramatica , Genre becomes a tool for infusing personality into a story , rather than a simple cataloging device . <p> December 8 , 2011 <h> Familiar Patterns of Story Structure <p> The types of conflict within a story carry with them a unique narrative code , much like the genetic code within DNA .

While most would attribute this similarity to Campbell 's monomyth , the truth of the reality is there is something deeper and more purposeful going on . <h> Explorations of Similar Areas of Conflict <p> Earlier in this series on conflict , we explored the four major areas of problematic conflict as outlined by the Dramatica theory of story .

A popular combination , especially in Western culture , has the Main Character in a Problematic Situation , the Influence Character in Fixed Attitude , the Overall Story in Activity and the Relationship Story in a Thought Process .

Chances are the prevailing gender behind most Western film ( i.e. , men ) find it more comfortable placing a conflict they do n't understand ( Thought Processes ) in a throughline they generally do n't get ( Relationships ) . <p> But that 's just a guess . <p> Regardless , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature a Main Character who is essentially a fish-out-of-water or a stranger in a strange land ( Problematic Situation ) . They find a strong-willed native defined by what they believe ( Problematic Fixed Attitude ) . This belief forces the Main Character to grow , to reconsider how they approach things . Naturally , the two develop a Relationship that involves changing the way they both see things ( though more often than not , focusing only on changing the Main Character 's Thought Process ) . And all this happens against the backdrop of evil colonists consuming and devastating a peaceful landscape ( Problematic Activity ) . <p> More than myth , these films sharpen their lasers of dramatic focus upon the same targets of conflict . <p> But what if we moved beyond simply focusing on the descriptive commonalities of setting and storytelling , that of the " white " colonist in a strange native land , and instead focused our attention on the types of conflict within each throughline . Would other popular American Western-culture films follow the same patterns of conflict ? <h> A Pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wars follows this same pattern . Luke Skywalker finds conflict in a Problematic Situation--farm boy stuck at the outer edge of the galaxy . His Influence Character Ben Kenobi , the one responsible for motivating Luke 's personal growth , sits directly across from him in the Genre chart . Fixed Attitude defines Old Obi Wan--his belief in the Force and its power to transform lives shows no signs of wavering . <p> In this respect , Ben 's impact on Luke calls to mind the same dramatic forces found in How to Train Your Dragon . As explained in the article A Conflict Unlike Any Other , Hiccup 's diminutive status ( Situation ) found great resistance in his father 's strict mindset ( Fixed Attitude ) . But unlike Stoick in that Viking epic , Ben 's Fixed Attitude in this space opera is a positive influence . This is yet another example of how Dramatica 's take on story structure refuses to dictate how to tell a story point . It does suggest the thematic substance of the story point , but how it unfolds , positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author ( as it naturally should ) . <p> Looking at the other two Throughlines , Star Wars continues to follow the same pattern . The main story , or A story line , centers around Problematic Activities between the bad and the good--stealing plans , storming diplomatic ships , shooting lasers , blowing up planets--all interstellar conflict defined by activity . <p> In the other corner sits the Relationship between Luke and Ben and that common exploration of Problematic Thought Processes . Beyond Luke 's issues with where he is and Ben 's attitude towards the Force , the conflict between them adds that key missing ingredient needed to make the story complete . <p> Often , when viewed within the context of a relationship , this special corner of the Genre chart looks more like Manipulations rather than Ways of Thinking or Thought Processes . Technically , they all mean the same thing , but due to the fact this is a problematic area of the chart for many Authors to understand ( the aforementioned Male half of the population ) , the shorter definition eases the comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old wizard does : be one with the mystical ways of the Jedi Knights and you too can do miraculous things . These manipulations define the tension in their relationship and offer the final cornerstone that completes the story 's exploration of the inequity . <h> The Matrix Within The Matrix <p> As with the constant comparison between Avatar and Pocahontas , many compared The Matrix to Star Wars ? When we first met Neo , many likened him to Luke Skywalker . Morpheus looks like a modern-day Obi Wan . Again , Campbell was often the center of such conversations , but those discussions were missing the trees for the mystical forest . <p> Like Luke , Neo finds conflict in a Situation - he is the One and does n't want to be . Like Ben , Morpheus believes strongly in one thing : in this case , that Mr. Andersen is the savior he has been waiting for . Instead of space battles and laser-sword fights , The Matrix features kung-fu fighting and over-the-top gun battles . Yet still all found under the umbrella of Activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Morpheus and Neo is one of Manipulation ( " Free your mind ... " ) . <p> Beyond simply aping a sequence of " mythical " story beats , the writers behind The Matrix managed to assimilate the exact areas of conflict found in Star Wars . That familiar feeling between the two is more than the stuff of legend , it is quantifiable dramatic focus . <h> Fortune Cookie Patterns <p> This popular pattern extends into the animation sector of modern American animation . Like Star Wars , The Matrix and How to Train Your Dragon , Kung Fu Panda focuses its areas of conflict on similar problems . Po 's Situation ? Beyond his obvious weight issues , Po is the son of the Noodle Soup king--nowhere close to his dream of fighting alongside the Furious Five . Shifu 's attitude ? Unlike Morpheus and Ben , this Influence Character believes wholeheartedly that Po is NOT the one . Their Relationship ? This time it 's Po trying to do the convincing , in addition to the traditional changes to thinking that come from a mentor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mayhem spurred on by an evil Villain . <h> The Commonality of Conflict <p> These repeated patterns of Genre explain why all these films have a familiar ring to them . Regardless of subject matter , stories explores the same KIND of conflict . Their Main Characters deal with Problematic Situations , their Influence Characters strict attitudes , their Relationship between those two characters deals in Manipulations and finally , their Overall Stories deal with Problematic Activities . <p> Want to create a similar feel to these films ? Set up a similar construct with your own story . Want to create something different , something a bit off the norm ? Mix and match the throughlines into a different combination that an Audience wo n't expect . As always , there is nothing wrong with one particular structural base , only options for Authors who wish to infuse their stories with meaning and purpose . <p> December 13 , 2011 <h> Not-So Familiar Patterns of Story Structure <p> Crafting a story that examines conflict from a different angle challenges the expectations of an Audience familiar with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commonality within story , the real key to unique storytelling lies in understanding the power of perspective . <p> The last two articles in this series on Conflict introduced the idea of the Four Throughlines and the Four Major Areas of Conflict . By attaching a Throughline ( or perspective ) to one of these areas , an Author sets up the personality of the story . The article Familiar Patterns of Story Structure covered the prevailing structural arrangement , or personality , found in most American films . Why do Star Wars , The Matrix , Die Hard , How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar seem familiar ? Beyond beat sheets and mythical stages , these films focus their storytelling on the same kind of conflict . This similarity guides them into the same structural Genre . <p> The Main Character finds themselves personally faced with a Problematic Situation . The Influence Character by his or her Fixed Attitude . The Relationship between the two revolves around their Problematic Ways of Thinking and the Overall Story examines Problematic Activities as a whole . <p> But what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Character positions ? Would it feel any different than the films listed above ? The Overall Story Throughline would still lie in Activity so it should n't make a difference , right ? . There would still be the usual kicking , stealing , fighting , grabbing and killing . But what if the Main Character was suddenly facing a problem of Attitude rather than a problem of Situation like their status in life or physicality ? <p> What would that film feel like ? <h> Casablanca and the Main Character <p> For starters , you might end up with this 1942 classic that many consider one of the best films of the 20th century . Like Star Wars , The Matrix , Avatar and Kung Fu Panda , Casablanca focuses its Overall Story Throughline on Problematic Activities . How else would one categorize the problems found in hiding stolen exit visas and escaping the clutches of evil Nazis ? And like most action films , both the Main Character and Influence Character in Casablanca find themselves in a battle over how each other thinks ( Problematic Ways of Thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind about her and about those visas , perhaps things could work out for them . <p> And this gives us a bit of a clue as to why Rick 's Throughline fits better in Fixed Attitude rather than the Situational area of conflict . Rick has no problem with the way he looks , with where he is living , or his status within Casablanca . What Rick does have though is a very bad , very sour attitude . " I stick my neck out for no one , " tells of a rather opinionated Main Character . Most importantly though , is that this opinion creates major problems for him . It is where he will have to do the most growing as a character . <p> What about Ilsa as a Situation Influence Character ? Besides being the most beautiful woman in the world ( which certainly has an impact on poor Rick ! ) , Ilsa 's status as the wife of a selfless freedom fighter gives Rick 's bad attitude a moment of pause . How can he keep this facade up when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give of herself for others ? <p> As you can see , this structural setup has a slightly different personality from the films covered in the last article . Instead of focusing on all the problems Rick creates because of what he is doing ( like Luke or Po ) , the emphasis here lies in what Rick is not doing . Getting Rick to stick his neck out ? That 's what the whole story tries to prove is a good thing . <h> Fixated Fish <p> And that same dynamic , that same cause for growth in Rick , orbits around Marlin in Pixar 's Finding Nemo . Like the saloon owner in Northern Africa , father Marlin struggles with a strict mindset : he knows what his son can and can not do . The constant worrying and obsessing over safety ? That 's a Fixed Attitude that creates problems personally for him and for those around him . <p> And what about Nemo ? His one-fin handicap puts him smartly in the Situation Throughline . This impacts Marlin 's attitude , shines a light on father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If what Marlin believes is true , that his son ca n't do these things , then why on Earth can the little guy keep proving that he can ? Surely one of them must be wrong ... <p> Like Rick , it is not so much what Marlin is doing that is causing him grief , but rather what he wo n't open himself up to . Give that little guy some distance and look what he can do . This is how rigid opinions change their course in stories of adventure . <h> Off the Beaten Path <p> There is nothing wrong with the familiar Situational Main Character , but as you can see , a different kind of story exists where the central character finds themselves at the mercy of an opinion . Finding Nemo and Casablanca are n't exactly bargain-bin disasters ; they 're both masterworks of storytelling that will continue to prevail long after we 're all gone . <p> Authors have the ability to sway opinions , to shift the attitudes of an Audience simply by the juxtaposition of perspective and problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engages their senses of delight and surprise . Tack on a meaningful argument , something important you want to say with your words , and the Audience will assume that message with ease and wonderment. 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> This consistent focus on what is lacking within the Main Character of these films occurs because of the location of the Main Character and Overall Story Throughlines . When they are in this vertical alignment ( with the OS in Activity and the MC in Fixed Attitude ) , the Main Character will feel as if they have a " hole in their heart . " <p> Dramatica refers to this important structural concept as the Main Character Growth and gives two choices : Stop or Start . With the Throughlines arranged as above , the Growth is Start . Arranged in the familiar Western culture alignment ( found in the last article ) , the Growth is Stop . These films tell stories of Main Characters who need to Stop what it is they are doing ( Stop testing yourself all the time , Luke , and Neo , stop thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their heart , these Main Characters appear as having a chip on their shoulder . Again , this reality of story structure occurs naturally because of where the Author chooses to focus their perspectives ( throughlines ) in a story . <p> December 18 , 2011 <h> Naturally Structuring a Story for Conflict <p> Effective stories deliver meaning to an Audience . The degree with which the structure of the story matches the thought processes going on within the receptive minds of those watching or reading shapes how cogent that message , or meaning , will be . <p> Communication without friction , or at least , as little friction as possible : that should be the goal of most comprehensive stories . In order to achieve this , a writer should use the Dramatica concept of the Four Throughlines . Labeled the Overall Story Throughline , Main Character Throughline , Influence Character Throughline and Relationship Story Throughline , these match the Four Perspectives through which the human mind can appreciate conflict : They , I , You , and We , respectively . Assigning these four Perspectives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality . <p> As mentioned in the first article of this series , A Conflict Unlike Any Other , the Main Character Throughline and the Influence Character Throughline are always across from each on the Structural Chart . Having the two Throughlines across from one another creates a natural connection when it comes to dramatic growth . Fixed Attitude causing you problems ? Entering into a relationship with someone defined by their Situation and you 're going to have to do some growing . Thinking about things in a way that is causing you grief ? Start a friendship with someone who constantly gets into trouble because of what they do ( Activity ) , and your whole world will turn upside-down ( A structural setup covered in a future article ) . <p> But is there a concrete reason as to why these two Throughlines have to be across from one another ? <h> A Model Designed for Conflict <p> The deeper reason for this rule lies in the makeup of the structural chart itself : Dynamic pairs ( those items diagonally across from one another ) offer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Faith lies across from Disbelief , Avoid from Pursuit , and Logic from Feeling . As Chris Huntley , co-creator of the Dramatica theory of story , recently said : <p> Yes , dynamic pairs offer the most opportunity for direct conflict . While not strictly binary , they come the closest to representing binary choices . We chose dynamic pairs as the basis for the Dramatica structure because they are a key component to linear thinking , which mirrors the bias of most American culture . <p> Other potential models of story might find the Main Character and Influence Character in a horizontal or vertical relationship , but they would not come close to approximating the sort of conflict found in popular American culture ( i.e. , Hollywood films ) . While it would be great for someone to explore other structural models later this century , for now the film industry--and story at large--has enough on its hands trying to make this model work . Besides , the binary conflict found in the diagonal pairs suffices for the kinds of stories Audiences crave today . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flopped the Main Character Throughline with the Influence Character Throughline in order to create a story with a different flavor . As we saw with Casablanca and Ratatouille , this switch gave the stories a unique personality . In addition , having a Main Character struggle with Fixed Attitudes while the story at large centers on Activities forces the Main Character to " arc " in a different way than if the Main Character struggled with their physicality or their station in life . <p> But what if we returned the Main Character to that position in the Situation domain and instead flopped the Overall Story and Relationship Story Throughlines ? Crafting a story where the characters struggle with how they think rather than how they act almost feels like it would be a story without interest . <p> Closer examination proves this assumption unstable . <h> Surviving the Fashion Industry <p> Cut-throat , inter-office politics . Backstabbing and persuasions . The fashion industry finds conflict within the subtle and not-so-subtle manipulations between those who populate it . It is not so much what the characters do in The Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought processes and their maniacal desires to get to the top ( or stay there ) . <p> Miranda is one of those already at the top . Everyone at worships her . Yet , it is n't her Situation that defines her . Rather it is her Fixed Attitude and her belief that she always knows what is right that has the most impact on Main Character Alex . Alex 's Problematic Situation ? Fresh out of college and defined by her lack of fashion sense , Alex must take what Miranda says seriously if the young upstart wants to be a success . <p> And here is where things get interesting . <p> Unlike the relationships between Luke and Ben or Morpheus and Neo , the relationship between Alex and Miranda centers on what each can do for the other . Miranda can jumpstart Alex 's career by leaps and bounds if only the young ingenue plays the game . Running crazy errands , making difficult phone calls , and in general doing the bidding of the queen of couture , describe some of the difficult things Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conflict in their relationship centers around activities , not how they think . <p> Now that we 've switched the Main Character into a Problematic Situation and the Overall Story Throughline into Thought Processes , that same vertical relationship found in Casablanca and Finding Nemo exists . This means ( assuming you 've read the article Not-So Familiar Patterns of Story Structure ) , that Alex has some growing to do . She lacks an essential trait that many in her similar position face : they do n't realize what they already have . <h> A Rat for Every Season <p> Believe it or not , Pixar 's Ratatouille shares a similar structural setup to the above fashion flick . But instead of focusing the story on what it is the Main Character lacks , Ratatouille gives us a great example of a Main Character waiting for others to finally see the light . <p> Like Alex and Luke and Hiccup and Neo , Remy finds conflict because of his unique Situation : he 's a rat . Whether it 's a gun-toting granny , aloof French chefs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it difficult to live because of who he is . <p> Across from him sits Linguini--a sad sack who finds difficulty overcoming the Fixed Attitudes of those around him . He 's a " garbage boy " , nothing more . ( Interesting digression here ... these areas of conflict can be an attribute of the Influence Character or , as in this case , attributed to them . Either way it does n't matter , because in the world of story all that matters is the idea of the Influence Character and how he or she ends up creating some sort of impact on the Main Character . ) <p> Remy has issues with prejudice because of his external appearance . Linguini has similar issues because of what others think about him ( internal ) . The presence of one naturally forces the other to grow . This is the beauty of the Dramatica structural model : its ability to accurately assess the qualities of a great story and to give a framework for natural conflict . <p> Together , the two do their best to work together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Problematic Activities . Their Relationship is physical comedy , and not found in the Overall Story Throughline . Instead , the film centers the Overall part of the story on the problems created by those who think " Anyone can cook " and those who think the same . Here , it 's not space battles and kung-fu fighting that becomes the center of conflict . Instead , like Prada , Ratatouille focuses on characters manipulating one another in an effort to move ahead . The way characters think creates the conflict . <h> Sophistication and Storytelling <p> Does Ratatouille feel more sophisticated than Kung Fu Panda ? Certainly . The themes are more complex , the areas of conflict unique and surprising . Giving the audience what they expect is fine in some respects , but sometimes it can be helpful to turn things on their side and look at the problems and conflicts we face from a different point-of-view . <p> This is all the structural chart is saying . It is not dictating what to say or how to say it , it is merely giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to say and the tools to broadcast that message . Crafting a story with this natural story structure in mind guarantees the easily delivery of the purposeful writer 's meaningful agenda . <p> In short , it helps writers broadcast their messages loud and clear . <p> December 23 , 2011 <h> Exotic Story Structure Often Unexplored <p> The challenge of the new . No writer wishes to repeat themselves . No writer wishes to simply rehash conflicts of old . Yet , without knowing truly what it is they are writing , many authors blindly follow the well-worn path of conflict . <p> By assigning the four Throughlines of a story ( Overall Story , Main Character , Influence Character and Relationship Story ) to one of these problematic areas of conflict , a writer imbues a work of narrative fiction with a distinct tangible personality . <h> Shifting the Axis of Conflict <p> In earlier articles the Overall Story Throughline , or main area of conflict , confined itself to either Problematic Activities or Problematic Ways of Thinking ; in other words the characters as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Western storytelling prefers this external or internal look at procedural conflict , stories do exist where the characters as a whole face conflicts of a static nature . Whether facing some Problematic Situation or Problematic Fixed Attitude , the characters in these stories find themselves faced with something stuck . <p> Getting that thing or things unstuck generally becomes the Goal of such a story . <h> Get Busy Living <p> In The Shawshank Redemption one would assume that Red ( Morgan Freeman ) is the one stuck , and by accepting the call to " Get busy livin ' " he becomes unstuck . A closer look at the structural conflicts proves this incorrect . <p> In the hallowed halls of this sad prison , lifer Red comes to meet and befriend fresh fish Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ) . This relationship--the heart of the story--focuses on the nature of hope and if it is " a dangerous thing . " Their conflicting attitudes about this issue puts the Relationship Throughline of this story in the Fixed Attitude section . Instantly one can sense the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing one another , manipulating the other into thinking the way he or she does , the relationship now centers on two incompatible views . I think this , You think that and one of them has to change . Definitely a different feel to this kind of Relationship Throughline . <p> Utilizing the reasoning elaborated on within the article Naturally Structuring a Story for Conflict , this would put the Overall Story Throughline firmly in a Problematic Situation . What is the problem that brings everyone in the story together ? An innocent man has been unjustly accused . " I 'm innocent , " Andy says . Yeah , right , and so is everyone else . They 're all stuck , and again , instead of fighting it out within the scope of activities or collectively backstabbing each other in a game of manipulations , here Stephen King explores the ups and downs of facing a problematic fixed situation . <h> Deciphering Objective and Subjective Views <p> Note the difference between this structural set-up and that of Star Wars , The Matrix or Finding Nemo . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Situations to one or two characters , a story like The Shawshank Redemption incorporates everyone into the struggle against fixation . It takes an objective view of this static area of conflict . This leaves the more process-oriented conflicts of Activities and Ways of Thinking to the subjective throughlines of Main Character and Influence Character . <p> Red and Andy . Who suffers from a Problematic Way of Thinking and who struggles with Problematic Activities ? Think back to Red 's meetings with the parole board . What issue does he run across ? To say what you think they want you to say , to think you have to kiss up and support those who hold power of you , showcases the thinking of an institutionalized man . Red says he is a changed man because he does n't want to rock the boat , he 's saying what he thinks he needs to say . That 's a character struggling with a Problematic Way of Thinking . <p> This puts Andy in the Problematic Activities area and again , yet another example of how the structural chart naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether it 's hiding from the " Sisters " , dangling on the precipice of a freshly tarred roof or digging his way through miles of ... stuff ... Andy 's conflict is all about what he does and ca n't do . <h> A Main Character Apart <p> How exciting and exotic is it to consider writing a story where the central character struggles with the way they go about thinking things ? It is not like Kung Fu Panda or How to Train Your Dragon or Welcome to the Dollhouse where the Main Character has to overcome their physicality . And it 's not like Finding Nemo or Unforgiven where that personal take on conflict focuses on a mindset that needs changing . Here you have a Main Character struggling with a dysfunctional psychology . How tantalizing ! <p> This is perhaps the reason why so many are quick to relegate Red to a " point-of-view " character or a " second protagonist " . Understanding the personal conflict of someone dealing with a Situation or an Attitude ? That 's easy , or more recognizable for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stories that take this approach and because of life itself . Who has n't felt ostracized for how they look ( Situation ) ? And who has n't discovered they were truly wrong about something ( Fixed Attitude ) ? <p> But questioning the way one goes about thinking of something ? It 's a concept so foreign that most writers would n't even bother considering it . <p> But Stephen King did . And for his efforts , we received The Shawshank Redemption . Shakespeare as well thought it an intriguing area of conflict to explore when he wrote Hamlet . And what a priceless treasure that play has been over the years . To be or not to be ? No struggle here with physicality or errant opinion . Clearly , the Prince of Denmark struggles with his own conception of himself and how best to carry out his plan--a struggle with the internal process . <h> An Opportunity For Something New <p> The Dramatica structural chart affords writers the chance to write something truly unique , something truly off the beaten path . The problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new . When you consider the recent slate of films--geared more towards selling toys and building upon deep-rooted properties--the notion of diving into the intricacies of how a character thinks and the struggle to overcome deficiencies comes off unappealing , unattractive and an easy one to pass on . <p> But with the rise and ease of distribution of self-publishing , the chance for writers to explore this uncharted territory becomes unavoidable , a siren song among the common . Sure , one can easily write great stories of Main Characters plagued with their station in life ( The King 's Speech ) or stuck with troubling assumptions ( Up in the Air ) , but consider the challenge of writing something as wonderfully complex as The Shawshank Redemption or Hamlet . <p> The opportunity is there . The difficulty lies in writing this kind of story so well that everyone clamors for it regardless of its potential at the box office . The exotic carries with it great risk , but also great reward for those willing to push themselves . <p> December 27 , 2011 <h> Drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of an audience : give them a personal look at one character 's struggle with conflict . Leave this important passageway undefined and an Author risks disinterest and disdain . <p> In this series on Conflict , the focus has stayed on a holistic understanding of story structure . Regardless of the type of story , each throughline--Overall Story , Main Character , Influence Character and Relationship Story--received an equal and appropriate amount of attention . Yet in doing so one throughline in particular , the most important in terms of capturing the attention of an audience , managed to escape the analysis with one important aspect overlooked . <p> Main Characters can suffer from deficient ways of thinking , like Red in The Shawshank Redemption and Hamlet in Hamlet ( as covered in Exotic Story Structure Often Unexplored ) . Others can face challenges with their physicality or their station in life ( Wikus Van De Merwe in District 9 or Mike Flaherty in Win Win ) . Still other Main Characters combat difficult or troublesome attitudes ( Theo in Children of Men or Amelie in Amelie ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Characters beset by problems of activities . <h> Main Characters That Do Troublesome Things <p> Recognizing stories where every character engages in difficult activities ( Rebels vs . The Empire in Star Wars and Destroying the Ring in The Lord of the Rings ) and stories where individual relationships focus on the same ( Lester and Ricky in American Beauty ) , stories that focus the problematic activity on the most personal of throughlines take on a different personality . William Wallace in Braveheart , Woody in the first Toy Story , and Hogarth in The Iron Giant serve as excellent examples of Main Characters who face trouble because of what they do . <h> Characters Who Ca n't Help Themselves <p> Wallace finds conflict not in the way he appears ( Situation ) , not in what he thinks ( Fixed Attitude ) or even how he thinks ( Psychology ) , but rather in the things he does ( Activities ) . Seeking revenge on his wife 's murderer , plundering English forts and stepping in where few dare to tread--Wallace creates trouble for himself because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Iron Giant . His sense of adventure and his natural desire to collect stray creatures ( both organic and mineral ) defines his character and the type of conflict the audience can expect from his personal Throughline . That optimistic drive to do ? That 's Hogarth through and through . <p> Understanding that the Influence Character 's Throughline sits directly across from the Main Character on the structural chart puts the Iron Giant himself in a Problematic Way of Thinking or deficient psychology . Locked in a constant struggle of who he is and what he should be , the Giant reflects Hogarth 's adventurous spirit in his own internal quest . The two bounce off each other--one external , one internal--until the end , when the Giant must finally take that step into the external and finally take some action . <p> But what about those Main Characters who suffer from a lack of action ? <h> Why Wo n't Anyone Play With Me ? <p> Woody 's throughline offers an excellent opportunity to expand on this idea of areas of conflict within a story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things Woody does that creates problems for him ( though he does tend to jump into things quickly , calling meetings , getting into fights , etc. ) , as it is the lack of someone playing with him . <p> An interesting facet of these areas of conflict lies in the fact that they can either be problems engaged in or problems attributed to the Throughline in question . Remember that a Main Character in the Fixed Attitude corner of the structural chart can either suffer from a bad mindset ( Scrooge in A Christmas Carol ) or have others think badly of him ( William Munny in Unforgiven ) . Either way satisfies the definition of a conflict stemming from problematic mindsets . Again , it is the purpose behind the throughline that is more important than its portrayal . <p> With Woody , an audience becomes personally familiar with the plight of someone not engaging in " playtime . " This lack of activity ripens any self-esteem issues a toy could possibly have and turns the conflict with Activity on its side . <h> The Entirety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with who they are , what they do , how they think or what they think , the Main Character gives writers the opportunity to explore conflict on a personal level . This unique quality , separate from the story-wide problem found in the Overall Story Throughline or the relational conflict found in the Relationship Throughline , draws an audience into a story . Without this unique perspective on conflict and the struggle to resolve it , the audience sits apart from the work in question , unable to emotionally invest themselves in the events on-screen or in type . <h> Stories That Fail to Engage <p> Consider recent emotionally-bereft pieces like Captain America . This latest disaster from Marvel had the best of intentions with its dork-to-champ story , yet for some reason tossed this personal throughline aside to focus on the silly tale of a red-masked Nazi and his super-weapon . If the authors did n't want to focus Cap 's story on the obvious Situational conflict ( weakling with muscles ) , they could have at least explored what happens when a superhero goes too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to seek out bullies and proactively seek revenge ? Certainly , and focusing his throughline on Problematic Activities would have solved this lack of emotional connection to the film . It would have called for an Influence Character with a Problematic Way of Thinking like Robert the Bruce or Buzz , but that 's an entirely different problem ! Regardless , an audience needs personal conflict in order to become engaged with a story . <p> Other vacant emotional tales ? Fast Five . The writers did n't even try , leaving this Summer dud one boring race car sequence after the next . Transformers : Dark of the Moon ? Like Captain America 's hero , at least Witwicki started out with some personal turmoil . True , Sam was only looking for a job , but at least it gave the audience something ! However , just like Cap , Witwicki 's personal conflict was soon overshadowed by mayhem and Dutch angles . <p> Even Mission Impossible 4 : Ghost Protocol , despite its phenomenal performance at the box office this season , failed to give audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare-doing atop the Burg Dubai was beyond exciting , yet without something personal to him for us to grab a hold of , his feats became more spectacle than meaningful . There was an effort to graft something on about his long-lost wife , but the exploration of this problem was so under-developed that the film post-Dubai dragged and plodded through its final Indian act . The fights were exciting , but without a well-defined personal conflict there was little reason to care or become emotionally invested . <h> Looking for Someone like Us <p> Is it perhaps reductive to isolate a Main Character 's Throughline to only one area of conflict ? Not if one understands the purpose of a throughline in defining the personality of a story . Effective stories reflect the problem-solving process of the human mind . To jump from one area to the next invites a sort of narrative schizophrenia that will only serve to confuse and frustrate the audience . <p> Anything is possible when it comes to art so yes , a writer could scatter the focus of a Main Character across several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees that the final product will not be something relatable except to those demented and irrational members of the audience . Audiences want stories that imitate those thought processes they are already so familiar with . The Main Character 's Throughline gives them that experience of I know exactly how he feels ... Anything less and that glowing exit sign becomes more of a lure than the images flickering on-screen . <p> December 31 , 2011 <h> Conflict of a Different Nature <p> In story , the forces of conflict arrange themselves in unique and natural patterns . When balanced properly , a story can deliver substance and meaning on a scale unheard of in lesser delivery mechanisms . <p> Beyond offering Authors insight as to why their stories might be struggling , this understanding also allows writers to infuse their work with an originality and purpose difficult to attain through mere muscle . Recognizing the most common patterns of conflict and sampling those not-so common patterns broadens the knowledge-base of those who work in narrative fiction while freeing their imagination to consider new possibilities . <h> The Same Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story structure as the best means towards creating a story of substance . Whether it be through a template of beats or a heroic journey from one world to the next , this advice aids the writer , yet never truly tells them as to why they should be adhering these ideas . Lacking a concrete explanation as to the meaning of these story points , the writer can do little more than follow along and hope for the best . More often than not , this approach leads to the same story , told in the same way , with little to no substance . <p> Contrast this sad result with the varied opportunities left open to writers who understand Dramatica 's concept of the Four Throughlines . As we have seen throughout this series , the order or beats that a story goes through pale in comparison to the power of focusing a story 's conflict on purposeful explorations of unique and connected throughlines . What there is to cover becomes far more important than hitting those beats . <p> With this approach , the writer can avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muse to create with intent . <h> Stories of Internal Struggle <p> Complete stories cover external and internal conflicts simultaneously . Certain parts of a story will focus on the efforts in the physical world , while others will emphasize the struggle within . Hollywood tends to favor the external struggle found in situations and activities . Why ? Visual medium , visual moments of conflict . Rarely do they venture inwards--such an act generally calls for a more ponderous medium . <p> In the article on exotic story structures , conversation centered around Main Characters with deficient ways of thinking . Both Red in The Shawshank Redemption and Hamlet in his self-titled play stood up as suitable candidates for this particular type of conflict . Yet in the big picture , these two stories explore different areas of conflict . <p> Shawshank tells the story of men consumed by an intolerable situation . Hamlet , on the other hand , tells the story of men ( and a woman or two ) consumed by their obsessions and the obsessions of others . Hamlet 's sustained grief for his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of overall story-wide conflict that comes from Problematic Fixed Attitudes . Conflict exists because of what everyone thinks , not because of their particular situation . Matched with Hamlet 's personal struggle over the way he thinks , this universal look at conflicting attitudes creates a story with a personality unlike any other . <p> Why are n't there more movies that take advantage of this unique setup ? <p> Communicating deficient psychologies and conflicting mindsets becomes somewhat of a challenge within the sparse confines of a screenplay . Stories that share this particular story " personality " --Amadeus and The Great Gatsby to name a few--stand out in mediums where the struggle over the internal can more readily play out . Novels and plays embrace the internal with a confidence Hollywood can not . Still , the convenience of that reality does not preclude the possibility of success . Amadeus did pretty well and continues to sit atop many of the " greatest films of all time " charts . For the adventurous and resolute screenwriter the challenge of visualizing the internal lies in wait . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle , this series on Conflict comes to an end . A comprehensive understanding of conflict and the throughlines that explore them met . Whether internal or external , state or process , every kind of inequity in the known Universe has its spot within the world of story . <p> But that 's just it ... <p> ... known Universe . <p> These areas of conflict are not real . They 're not tangible . They do n't exist as much as they stand for our own perceptions of what we observe and sense . As Melanie Anne Phillips , co-creator of Dramatica , is always fond of quoting , " The energy that flows through a system tends to organize that system " ( Buckminister Fuller ) --meaning these areas of conflict are built by our own minds . Our personal operating systems call for conflict to fall down these lines . Because we create these stories , it is only natural that they reflect our own internal thought processes . <p> Stories are models of our own minds at work . The foundation for Dramatica sits upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason why every story written with the theory or every story that fits easily into its framework feels complete and comprehensive . As audience members , we know how we think . Stories that honor that knowledge find a special spot in our hearts and in our minds . <p> If our minds evolve then this structural chart will have to transform as well . But for now , its accuracy stays unparalleled . <p> The structural chart--these four Areas of Conflict and the Throughlines that attach to them--are not a " system " for creating Hollywood blockbusters . They are not templates or elaborate plotting machines . They are reflections of ourselves . It just so happens that those stories that reflect us the best often become the ones we honor the most--with ticket sales and gold statues .

@@119273626 @8273626/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Conflict <p> Writing great conflict into your stories is as simple as finding the context for an inequity , for without context there can be no conflict . Thankfully , the Dramatica theory of story offers writers several different ways to understand and create effective conflict . This multi-article series will reveal to you patterns of conflict you never knew existed . <p> December 5 , 2011 <h> A Conflict Unlike Any Other <p> Every engine needs a fuel source . Without a constant supply , the mechanism sputters and fails , eventually coming to a rest dormant and forgotten on a dried plain . How does one keep the bristling and shiny furnace of story steaming down those tracks ? <p> Through conflict . <p> Stories live and breathe conflict . Even the most rudimentary explanations of stories understand this . Consider this common insight that defines this essential ingredient as <p> the problem faced by the characters . Conflict happens when characters are against each other , like teams in a game or two groups fighting on the playground . <p> But when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from all the others , that delves deep into the inner psychological needs that audiences crave , an Author needs to understand in detail the forces that craft that conflict . <h> A Definition Apart <p> One of the greatest aspects of the Dramatica theory of story rests in the precision with which it tries to quantify the molecular level of story structure . This accuracy develops a level of trust unheard of in other competing paradigms or schools of thought . In a recent QnA with Dramatica co-creator Chris Huntley , the common concept of conflict gets a thorough evaluation : <p> Conflict is the product of effort to resolve an inequity as it meets resistance . We look for conflict as we attempt to identify an inequity 's source(s) . If we neglect to look in all the possible places conflict can exist , we open ourselves ( and the story ) to missing the entirety of the conflict and a true understanding of the inequity , leaving the real likelihood of failing to resolve the inequity thoroughly . So , all four perspectives and all four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an inequity and the nature and source(s) of conflict generated by trying to resolve the inequity . <h> Four Ways of Looking at Conflict <p> The four perspectives Huntley speaks of were well known before Dramatica . First person , third person , first person plural and third person plural . I , You , We and They . As explained in more detail within the article Writing Complete Stories , these four contexts have found their way into stories via the Main Character ( I ) , the Influence Character ( You ) , the Relationship Story ( We ) , and the Overall Story ( They ) Throughlines . <p> Hearing this for the first time , one might think Well , that seems right , but I 'm not sure ... Rest assured , there is a reason why these four throughlines appear in complete stories . <p> Ever heard the idea that " One man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . " This enlightened understanding of the world around us can offer much needed appreciation of why some stories simply feel more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they are crafting a balanced story if they leave out one side of the argument ? Authors need to inspect an issue from every direction--the four Throughlines . <p> And yet , while these four perspectives may be relatively familiar to most , it is what they are looking at that is unique to Dramatica 's understanding of story . <h> Four Areas That Define Problems <p> A Situation , a Fixed Attitude , an Activity , and a Thought Process . Think of a problem and it MUST fall into one of these categories . Racism ? That 's a fixed attitude . Unjustly accused of killing your wife ? That 's a situation . Wiping out an alien race ? Definitely an activity . Brow-beating your wife . That 's a thought process you might want to reconsider . Regardless of what problem an Author invents , it will fall into one of these four areas . <p> When an inequity hits the world of story , the forces that conspire to resolve it have no idea where the conflict is coming from . It could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure of a story simply ca n't figure out where the inequity lies--at least , not without some level of inaccuracy . This reality gives us a clue as to why Dramatica calls for all four areas of conflict to be present in a complete story . This is why Huntley states : <p> If we neglect to look in all the possible places conflict can exist , we open ourselves ( and the story ) to missing the entirety of the conflict and a true understanding of the inequity <p> Cover all four areas where problems can exist and like the advice to include all four perspectives , An Author can insure that their story ends up well-balanced and completely argued . <p> There wo n't be any story " holes " . <h> The Chart of a Story 's Personality <p> At the top level of Dramatica 's Model of Story sit the four Domains , or areas of conflict . <p> The way one can begin to fully understand why a story feels the way it does ( and why some feel more similar than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four Domains . Any combination is acceptable save for one rule : the Main Character and Influence Character Domains must be diagonally opposed to each other . Why ? <p> If the Main Character 's problems lie in a Situation and the Influence Character creates problems because of their Fixed Attitude , well then you have enough of a similarity between the two that growth can occur . A Situation describes something externally stuck . A Fixed Attitude describes something internally stuck . Both are static ( " You and I are both alike . " ) The line of dialogue that usually follows , " We are nothing alike " occurs because , while they both describe something fixed , one is external and one is internal . They are not completely alike . <p> This occurs in the animated film How to Train Your Dragon . Hiccup , the Main Character , finds personal trouble in his physicality , or Situation . He is a 98lb. weakling in a tribe of manly Vikings . " You just pointed to all of me , " refers to those issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father Stoick assumes the role of Influence Character . Using the above rule from Dramatica , the Influence Character must be in a diagonally opposed relationship to the Main Character on the structural chart . This puts Stoick in Fixed Attitude and helps define the kind of impact he 'll have on Hiccup . <p> Stoick . Stoic . Even his name confirms the placement ! <p> Interestingly enough , later on in the film Hiccup has the " He and I are both alike " moment , but uses it to describe his relationship with Toothless , not his father . While it helps explain Hiccup 's motivation for freeing the beast , its use outside of the norm tends to suggest that there should be even more exploration of their relationship beyond simply dragging sticks in the sand . It implies that there is still growth to be had in the relationship between them , when at that time their relationships was already rock solid . <h> Genre as a Tool <p> Dramatica considers this personality level of story structure--the Domain level--to be the most accurate and productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake Snyder and John Truby think of Genre in terms like Thrillers , Romantic Comedies and War Dramas . But beyond a handy shopping list of storytelling patterns , how truly helpful are these concepts in determining the scope of what it is an Author is trying to say ? How helpful are they in balancing the story 's points of view ? At best they identify the patterns . They never answer the question why ? <p> Everyone agrees that a story must have conflict . And while everyone also recognizes the necessity of seeing all sides of an argument , only one theory of story needs it for meaning . Dramatica moves beyond this reality by helping an Author build solid concrete arguments . With Dramatica , Genre becomes a tool for infusing personality into a story , rather than a simple cataloging device . <p> December 8 , 2011 <h> Familiar Patterns of Story Structure <p> The types of conflict within a story carry with them a unique narrative code , much like the genetic code within DNA . And just as a different combination of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , the mixture of these dramatic narrative forces decides the personality of a story . <p> But why is it that some stories seem to have the same personality ? If built on such complex genetic code , how do they all end up feeling the same ? Avatar was just Pocahontas , which itself was Dances with Wolves which itself spawned The Last Samurai and possibly Fern Gully . Regardless of the setting , all of these stories feel the same . While most would attribute this similarity to Campbell 's monomyth , the truth of the reality is there is something deeper and more purposeful going on . <h> Explorations of Similar Areas of Conflict <p> Earlier in this series on conflict , we explored the four major areas of problematic conflict as outlined by the Dramatica theory of story . Whether it be a Situation , an Activity , a Thought Process ( Way of Thinking ) or a Fixed Attitude , a problem must find a home somewhere within this chart . <p> In addition , we discovered that a successful Author attaches the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the entire scope of what it is they are trying to say with their story . Main Character , Influence Character , Relationship Story , and Overall Story . Four Throughlines , four general Areas of Conflict . Put a throughline in each area and the story will feel complete . <p> Attach them in a similar pattern to other stories and the stories themselves will begin to feel strikingly familiar . <h> Covering Familiar Territory <p> Where an Author decides to focus the conflict in their story defines the personality of that story . A popular combination , especially in Western culture , has the Main Character in a Problematic Situation , the Influence Character in Fixed Attitude , the Overall Story in Activity and the Relationship Story in a Thought Process . Why ? Chances are the prevailing gender behind most Western film ( i.e. , men ) find it more comfortable placing a conflict they do n't understand ( Thought Processes ) in a throughline they generally do n't get ( Relationships ) . <p> But that 's just a guess . <p> Regardless , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature a Main Character who is essentially a fish-out-of-water or a stranger in a strange land ( Problematic Situation ) . They find a strong-willed native defined by what they believe ( Problematic Fixed Attitude ) . This belief forces the Main Character to grow , to reconsider how they approach things . Naturally , the two develop a Relationship that involves changing the way they both see things ( though more often than not , focusing only on changing the Main Character 's Thought Process ) . And all this happens against the backdrop of evil colonists consuming and devastating a peaceful landscape ( Problematic Activity ) . <p> More than myth , these films sharpen their lasers of dramatic focus upon the same targets of conflict . <p> But what if we moved beyond simply focusing on the descriptive commonalities of setting and storytelling , that of the " white " colonist in a strange native land , and instead focused our attention on the types of conflict within each throughline . Would other popular American Western-culture films follow the same patterns of conflict ? <h> A Pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wars follows this same pattern . Luke Skywalker finds conflict in a Problematic Situation--farm boy stuck at the outer edge of the galaxy . His Influence Character Ben Kenobi , the one responsible for motivating Luke 's personal growth , sits directly across from him in the Genre chart . Fixed Attitude defines Old Obi Wan--his belief in the Force and its power to transform lives shows no signs of wavering . <p> In this respect , Ben 's impact on Luke calls to mind the same dramatic forces found in How to Train Your Dragon . As explained in the article A Conflict Unlike Any Other , Hiccup 's diminutive status ( Situation ) found great resistance in his father 's strict mindset ( Fixed Attitude ) . But unlike Stoick in that Viking epic , Ben 's Fixed Attitude in this space opera is a positive influence . This is yet another example of how Dramatica 's take on story structure refuses to dictate how to tell a story point . It does suggest the thematic substance of the story point , but how it unfolds , positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author ( as it naturally should ) . <p> Looking at the other two Throughlines , Star Wars continues to follow the same pattern . The main story , or A story line , centers around Problematic Activities between the bad and the good--stealing plans , storming diplomatic ships , shooting lasers , blowing up planets--all interstellar conflict defined by activity . <p> In the other corner sits the Relationship between Luke and Ben and that common exploration of Problematic Thought Processes . Beyond Luke 's issues with where he is and Ben 's attitude towards the Force , the conflict between them adds that key missing ingredient needed to make the story complete . <p> Often , when viewed within the context of a relationship , this special corner of the Genre chart looks more like Manipulations rather than Ways of Thinking or Thought Processes . Technically , they all mean the same thing , but due to the fact this is a problematic area of the chart for many Authors to understand ( the aforementioned Male half of the population ) , the shorter definition eases the comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old wizard does : be one with the mystical ways of the Jedi Knights and you too can do miraculous things . These manipulations define the tension in their relationship and offer the final cornerstone that completes the story 's exploration of the inequity . <h> The Matrix Within The Matrix <p> As with the constant comparison between Avatar and Pocahontas , many compared The Matrix to Star Wars ? When we first met Neo , many likened him to Luke Skywalker . Morpheus looks like a modern-day Obi Wan . Again , Campbell was often the center of such conversations , but those discussions were missing the trees for the mystical forest . <p> Like Luke , Neo finds conflict in a Situation - he is the One and does n't want to be . Like Ben , Morpheus believes strongly in one thing : in this case , that Mr. Andersen is the savior he has been waiting for . Instead of space battles and laser-sword fights , The Matrix features kung-fu fighting and over-the-top gun battles . Yet still all found under the umbrella of Activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Morpheus and Neo is one of Manipulation ( " Free your mind ... " ) . <p> Beyond simply aping a sequence of " mythical " story beats , the writers behind The Matrix managed to assimilate the exact areas of conflict found in Star Wars . That familiar feeling between the two is more than the stuff of legend , it is quantifiable dramatic focus . <h> Fortune Cookie Patterns <p> This popular pattern extends into the animation sector of modern American animation . Like Star Wars , The Matrix and How to Train Your Dragon , Kung Fu Panda focuses its areas of conflict on similar problems . Po 's Situation ? Beyond his obvious weight issues , Po is the son of the Noodle Soup king--nowhere close to his dream of fighting alongside the Furious Five . Shifu 's attitude ? Unlike Morpheus and Ben , this Influence Character believes wholeheartedly that Po is NOT the one . Their Relationship ? This time it 's Po trying to do the convincing , in addition to the traditional changes to thinking that come from a mentor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mayhem spurred on by an evil Villain . <h> The Commonality of Conflict <p> These repeated patterns of Genre explain why all these films have a familiar ring to them . Regardless of subject matter , stories explores the same KIND of conflict . Their Main Characters deal with Problematic Situations , their Influence Characters strict attitudes , their Relationship between those two characters deals in Manipulations and finally , their Overall Stories deal with Problematic Activities . <p> Want to create a similar feel to these films ? Set up a similar construct with your own story . Want to create something different , something a bit off the norm ? Mix and match the throughlines into a different combination that an Audience wo n't expect . As always , there is nothing wrong with one particular structural base , only options for Authors who wish to infuse their stories with meaning and purpose . <p> December 13 , 2011 <h> Not-So Familiar Patterns of Story Structure <p> Crafting a story that examines conflict from a different angle challenges the expectations of an Audience familiar with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commonality within story , the real key to unique storytelling lies in understanding the power of perspective . <p> The last two articles in this series on Conflict introduced the idea of the Four Throughlines and the Four Major Areas of Conflict . By attaching a Throughline ( or perspective ) to one of these areas , an Author sets up the personality of the story . The article Familiar Patterns of Story Structure covered the prevailing structural arrangement , or personality , found in most American films . Why do Star Wars , The Matrix , Die Hard , How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar seem familiar ? Beyond beat sheets and mythical stages , these films focus their storytelling on the same kind of conflict . This similarity guides them into the same structural Genre . <p> The Main Character finds themselves personally faced with a Problematic Situation . The Influence Character by his or her Fixed Attitude . The Relationship between the two revolves around their Problematic Ways of Thinking and the Overall Story examines Problematic Activities as a whole . <p> But what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Character positions ? Would it feel any different than the films listed above ? The Overall Story Throughline would still lie in Activity so it should n't make a difference , right ? . There would still be the usual kicking , stealing , fighting , grabbing and killing . But what if the Main Character was suddenly facing a problem of Attitude rather than a problem of Situation like their status in life or physicality ? <p> What would that film feel like ? <h> Casablanca and the Main Character <p> For starters , you might end up with this 1942 classic that many consider one of the best films of the 20th century . Like Star Wars , The Matrix , Avatar and Kung Fu Panda , Casablanca focuses its Overall Story Throughline on Problematic Activities . How else would one categorize the problems found in hiding stolen exit visas and escaping the clutches of evil Nazis ? And like most action films , both the Main Character and Influence Character in Casablanca find themselves in a battle over how each other thinks ( Problematic Ways of Thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind about her and about those visas , perhaps things could work out for them . <p> And this gives us a bit of a clue as to why Rick 's Throughline fits better in Fixed Attitude rather than the Situational area of conflict . Rick has no problem with the way he looks , with where he is living , or his status within Casablanca . What Rick does have though is a very bad , very sour attitude . " I stick my neck out for no one , " tells of a rather opinionated Main Character . Most importantly though , is that this opinion creates major problems for him . It is where he will have to do the most growing as a character . <p> What about Ilsa as a Situation Influence Character ? Besides being the most beautiful woman in the world ( which certainly has an impact on poor Rick ! ) , Ilsa 's status as the wife of a selfless freedom fighter gives Rick 's bad attitude a moment of pause . How can he keep this facade up when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give of herself for others ? <p> As you can see , this structural setup has a slightly different personality from the films covered in the last article . Instead of focusing on all the problems Rick creates because of what he is doing ( like Luke or Po ) , the emphasis here lies in what Rick is not doing . Getting Rick to stick his neck out ? That 's what the whole story tries to prove is a good thing . <h> Fixated Fish <p> And that same dynamic , that same cause for growth in Rick , orbits around Marlin in Pixar 's Finding Nemo . Like the saloon owner in Northern Africa , father Marlin struggles with a strict mindset : he knows what his son can and can not do . The constant worrying and obsessing over safety ? That 's a Fixed Attitude that creates problems personally for him and for those around him . <p> And what about Nemo ? His one-fin handicap puts him smartly in the Situation Throughline . This impacts Marlin 's attitude , shines a light on father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If what Marlin believes is true , that his son ca n't do these things , then why on Earth can the little guy keep proving that he can ? Surely one of them must be wrong ... <p> Like Rick , it is not so much what Marlin is doing that is causing him grief , but rather what he wo n't open himself up to . Give that little guy some distance and look what he can do . This is how rigid opinions change their course in stories of adventure . <h> Off the Beaten Path <p> There is nothing wrong with the familiar Situational Main Character , but as you can see , a different kind of story exists where the central character finds themselves at the mercy of an opinion . Finding Nemo and Casablanca are n't exactly bargain-bin disasters ; they 're both masterworks of storytelling that will continue to prevail long after we 're all gone . <p> Authors have the ability to sway opinions , to shift the attitudes of an Audience simply by the juxtaposition of perspective and problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engages their senses of delight and surprise .

When they are in this vertical alignment ( with the OS in Activity and the MC in Fixed Attitude ) , the Main Character will feel as if they have a " hole in their heart . " <p> Dramatica refers to this important structural concept as the Main Character Growth and gives two choices : Stop or Start . With the Throughlines arranged as above , the Growth is Start .

These films tell stories of Main Characters who need to Stop what it is they are doing ( Stop testing yourself all the time , Luke , and Neo , stop thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their heart , these Main Characters appear as having a chip on their shoulder .

In order to achieve this , a writer should use the Dramatica concept of the Four Throughlines .

Entering into a relationship with someone defined by their Situation and you 're going to have to do some growing . Thinking about things in a way that is causing you grief ? Start a friendship with someone who constantly gets into trouble because of what they do ( Activity ) , and your whole world will turn upside-down ( A structural setup covered in a future article ) . <p> But is there a concrete reason as to why these two Throughlines have to be across from one another ? <h> A Model Designed for Conflict <p> The deeper reason for this rule lies in the makeup of the structural chart itself : Dynamic pairs ( those items diagonally across from one another ) offer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Faith lies across from Disbelief , Avoid from Pursuit , and Logic from Feeling . As Chris Huntley , co-creator of the Dramatica theory of story , recently said : <p> Yes , dynamic pairs offer the most opportunity for direct conflict . While not strictly binary , they come the closest to representing binary choices . We chose dynamic pairs as the basis for the Dramatica structure because they are a key component to linear thinking , which mirrors the bias of most American culture . <p> Other potential models of story might find the Main Character and Influence Character in a horizontal or vertical relationship , but they would not come close to approximating the sort of conflict found in popular American culture ( i.e. , Hollywood films ) . While it would be great for someone to explore other structural models later this century , for now the film industry--and story at large--has enough on its hands trying to make this model work . Besides , the binary conflict found in the diagonal pairs suffices for the kinds of stories Audiences crave today . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flopped the Main Character Throughline with the Influence Character Throughline in order to create a story with a different flavor .

In addition , having a Main Character struggle with Fixed Attitudes while the story at large centers on Activities forces the Main Character to " arc " in a different way than if the Main Character struggled with their physicality or their station in life . <p> But what if we returned the Main Character to that position in the Situation domain and instead flopped the Overall Story and Relationship Story Throughlines ? Crafting a story where the characters struggle with how they think rather than how they act almost feels like it would be a story without interest . <p> Closer examination proves this assumption unstable . <h> Surviving the Fashion Industry <p> Cut-throat , inter-office politics .

Fresh out of college and defined by her lack of fashion sense , Alex must take what Miranda says seriously if the young upstart wants to be a success . <p> And here is where things get interesting . <p> Unlike the relationships between Luke and Ben or Morpheus and Neo , the relationship between Alex and Miranda centers on what each can do for the other . Miranda can jumpstart Alex 's career by leaps and bounds if only the young ingenue plays the game . Running crazy errands , making difficult phone calls , and in general doing the bidding of the queen of couture , describe some of the difficult things Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conflict in their relationship centers around activities , not how they think . <p> Now that we 've switched the Main Character into a Problematic Situation and the Overall Story Throughline into Thought Processes , that same vertical relationship found in Casablanca and Finding Nemo exists . This means ( assuming you 've read the article Not-So Familiar Patterns of Story Structure ) , that Alex has some growing to do . She lacks an essential trait that many in her similar position face : they do n't realize what they already have . <h> A Rat for Every Season <p> Believe it or not , Pixar 's Ratatouille shares a similar structural setup to the above fashion flick . But instead of focusing the story on what it is the Main Character lacks , Ratatouille gives us a great example of a Main Character waiting for others to finally see the light . <p> Like Alex and Luke and Hiccup and Neo , Remy finds conflict because of his unique Situation : he 's a rat . Whether it 's a gun-toting granny , aloof French chefs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it difficult to live because of who he is . <p> Across from him sits Linguini--a sad sack who finds difficulty overcoming the Fixed Attitudes of those around him . He 's a " garbage boy " , nothing more . ( Interesting digression here ... these areas of conflict can be an attribute of the Influence Character or , as in this case , attributed to them . Either way it does n't matter , because in the world of story all that matters is the idea of the Influence Character and how he or she ends up creating some sort of impact on the Main Character . ) <p> Remy has issues with prejudice because of his external appearance . Linguini has similar issues because of what others think about him ( internal ) . The presence of one naturally forces the other to grow . This is the beauty of the Dramatica structural model : its ability to accurately assess the qualities of a great story and to give a framework for natural conflict . <p> Together , the two do their best to work together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Problematic Activities . Their Relationship is physical comedy , and not found in the Overall Story Throughline . Instead , the film centers the Overall part of the story on the problems created by those who think " Anyone can cook " and those who think the same . Here , it 's not space battles and kung-fu fighting that becomes the center of conflict . Instead , like Prada , Ratatouille focuses on characters manipulating one another in an effort to move ahead . The way characters think creates the conflict . <h> Sophistication and Storytelling <p> Does Ratatouille feel more sophisticated than Kung Fu Panda ? Certainly . The themes are more complex , the areas of conflict unique and surprising . Giving the audience what they expect is fine in some respects , but sometimes it can be helpful to turn things on their side and look at the problems and conflicts we face from a different point-of-view . <p> This is all the structural chart is saying . It is not dictating what to say or how to say it , it is merely giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to say and the tools to broadcast that message . Crafting a story with this natural story structure in mind guarantees the easily delivery of the purposeful writer 's meaningful agenda . <p> In short , it helps writers broadcast their messages loud and clear . <p> December 23 , 2011 <h> Exotic Story Structure Often Unexplored <p> The challenge of the new . No writer wishes to repeat themselves . No writer wishes to simply rehash conflicts of old . Yet , without knowing truly what it is they are writing , many authors blindly follow the well-worn path of conflict . <p> By assigning the four Throughlines of a story ( Overall Story , Main Character , Influence Character and Relationship Story ) to one of these problematic areas of conflict , a writer imbues a work of narrative fiction with a distinct tangible personality . <h> Shifting the Axis of Conflict <p> In earlier articles the Overall Story Throughline , or main area of conflict , confined itself to either Problematic Activities or Problematic Ways of Thinking ; in other words the characters as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Western storytelling prefers this external or internal look at procedural conflict , stories do exist where the characters as a whole face conflicts of a static nature . Whether facing some Problematic Situation or Problematic Fixed Attitude , the characters in these stories find themselves faced with something stuck . <p> Getting that thing or things unstuck generally becomes the Goal of such a story . <h> Get Busy Living <p> In The Shawshank Redemption one would assume that Red ( Morgan Freeman ) is the one stuck , and by accepting the call to " Get busy livin ' " he becomes unstuck . A closer look at the structural conflicts proves this incorrect . <p> In the hallowed halls of this sad prison , lifer Red comes to meet and befriend fresh fish Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ) . This relationship--the heart of the story--focuses on the nature of hope and if it is " a dangerous thing . " Their conflicting attitudes about this issue puts the Relationship Throughline of this story in the Fixed Attitude section . Instantly one can sense the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing one another , manipulating the other into thinking the way he or she does , the relationship now centers on two incompatible views . I think this , You think that and one of them has to change . Definitely a different feel to this kind of Relationship Throughline . <p> Utilizing the reasoning elaborated on within the article Naturally Structuring a Story for Conflict , this would put the Overall Story Throughline firmly in a Problematic Situation . What is the problem that brings everyone in the story together ? An innocent man has been unjustly accused . " I 'm innocent , " Andy says . Yeah , right , and so is everyone else . They 're all stuck , and again , instead of fighting it out within the scope of activities or collectively backstabbing each other in a game of manipulations , here Stephen King explores the ups and downs of facing a problematic fixed situation . <h> Deciphering Objective and Subjective Views <p> Note the difference between this structural set-up and that of Star Wars , The Matrix or Finding Nemo . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Situations to one or two characters , a story like The Shawshank Redemption incorporates everyone into the struggle against fixation . It takes an objective view of this static area of conflict . This leaves the more process-oriented conflicts of Activities and Ways of Thinking to the subjective throughlines of Main Character and Influence Character . <p> Red and Andy . Who suffers from a Problematic Way of Thinking and who struggles with Problematic Activities ? Think back to Red 's meetings with the parole board . What issue does he run across ? To say what you think they want you to say , to think you have to kiss up and support those who hold power of you , showcases the thinking of an institutionalized man . Red says he is a changed man because he does n't want to rock the boat , he 's saying what he thinks he needs to say . That 's a character struggling with a Problematic Way of Thinking . <p> This puts Andy in the Problematic Activities area and again , yet another example of how the structural chart naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether it 's hiding from the " Sisters " , dangling on the precipice of a freshly tarred roof or digging his way through miles of ... stuff ... Andy 's conflict is all about what he does and ca n't do . <h> A Main Character Apart <p> How exciting and exotic is it to consider writing a story where the central character struggles with the way they go about thinking things ? It is not like Kung Fu Panda or How to Train Your Dragon or Welcome to the Dollhouse where the Main Character has to overcome their physicality . And it 's not like Finding Nemo or Unforgiven where that personal take on conflict focuses on a mindset that needs changing . Here you have a Main Character struggling with a dysfunctional psychology . How tantalizing ! <p> This is perhaps the reason why so many are quick to relegate Red to a " point-of-view " character or a " second protagonist " . Understanding the personal conflict of someone dealing with a Situation or an Attitude ? That 's easy , or more recognizable for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stories that take this approach and because of life itself . Who has n't felt ostracized for how they look ( Situation ) ? And who has n't discovered they were truly wrong about something ( Fixed Attitude ) ? <p> But questioning the way one goes about thinking of something ? It 's a concept so foreign that most writers would n't even bother considering it . <p> But Stephen King did . And for his efforts , we received The Shawshank Redemption . Shakespeare as well thought it an intriguing area of conflict to explore when he wrote Hamlet . And what a priceless treasure that play has been over the years . To be or not to be ? No struggle here with physicality or errant opinion . Clearly , the Prince of Denmark struggles with his own conception of himself and how best to carry out his plan--a struggle with the internal process . <h> An Opportunity For Something New <p> The Dramatica structural chart affords writers the chance to write something truly unique , something truly off the beaten path . The problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new . When you consider the recent slate of films--geared more towards selling toys and building upon deep-rooted properties--the notion of diving into the intricacies of how a character thinks and the struggle to overcome deficiencies comes off unappealing , unattractive and an easy one to pass on . <p> But with the rise and ease of distribution of self-publishing , the chance for writers to explore this uncharted territory becomes unavoidable , a siren song among the common . Sure , one can easily write great stories of Main Characters plagued with their station in life ( The King 's Speech ) or stuck with troubling assumptions ( Up in the Air ) , but consider the challenge of writing something as wonderfully complex as The Shawshank Redemption or Hamlet . <p> The opportunity is there . The difficulty lies in writing this kind of story so well that everyone clamors for it regardless of its potential at the box office . The exotic carries with it great risk , but also great reward for those willing to push themselves . <p> December 27 , 2011 <h> Drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of an audience : give them a personal look at one character 's struggle with conflict . Leave this important passageway undefined and an Author risks disinterest and disdain . <p> In this series on Conflict , the focus has stayed on a holistic understanding of story structure . Regardless of the type of story , each throughline--Overall Story , Main Character , Influence Character and Relationship Story--received an equal and appropriate amount of attention . Yet in doing so one throughline in particular , the most important in terms of capturing the attention of an audience , managed to escape the analysis with one important aspect overlooked . <p> Main Characters can suffer from deficient ways of thinking , like Red in The Shawshank Redemption and Hamlet in Hamlet ( as covered in Exotic Story Structure Often Unexplored ) . Others can face challenges with their physicality or their station in life ( Wikus Van De Merwe in District 9 or Mike Flaherty in Win Win ) . Still other Main Characters combat difficult or troublesome attitudes ( Theo in Children of Men or Amelie in Amelie ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Characters beset by problems of activities . <h> Main Characters That Do Troublesome Things <p> Recognizing stories where every character engages in difficult activities ( Rebels vs . The Empire in Star Wars and Destroying the Ring in The Lord of the Rings ) and stories where individual relationships focus on the same ( Lester and Ricky in American Beauty ) , stories that focus the problematic activity on the most personal of throughlines take on a different personality . William Wallace in Braveheart , Woody in the first Toy Story , and Hogarth in The Iron Giant serve as excellent examples of Main Characters who face trouble because of what they do . <h> Characters Who Ca n't Help Themselves <p> Wallace finds conflict not in the way he appears ( Situation ) , not in what he thinks ( Fixed Attitude ) or even how he thinks ( Psychology ) , but rather in the things he does ( Activities ) . Seeking revenge on his wife 's murderer , plundering English forts and stepping in where few dare to tread--Wallace creates trouble for himself because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Iron Giant . His sense of adventure and his natural desire to collect stray creatures ( both organic and mineral ) defines his character and the type of conflict the audience can expect from his personal Throughline . That optimistic drive to do ? That 's Hogarth through and through . <p> Understanding that the Influence Character 's Throughline sits directly across from the Main Character on the structural chart puts the Iron Giant himself in a Problematic Way of Thinking or deficient psychology . Locked in a constant struggle of who he is and what he should be , the Giant reflects Hogarth 's adventurous spirit in his own internal quest . The two bounce off each other--one external , one internal--until the end , when the Giant must finally take that step into the external and finally take some action . <p> But what about those Main Characters who suffer from a lack of action ? <h> Why Wo n't Anyone Play With Me ? <p> Woody 's throughline offers an excellent opportunity to expand on this idea of areas of conflict within a story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things Woody does that creates problems for him ( though he does tend to jump into things quickly , calling meetings , getting into fights , etc. ) , as it is the lack of someone playing with him . <p> An interesting facet of these areas of conflict lies in the fact that they can either be problems engaged in or problems attributed to the Throughline in question . Remember that a Main Character in the Fixed Attitude corner of the structural chart can either suffer from a bad mindset ( Scrooge in A Christmas Carol ) or have others think badly of him ( William Munny in Unforgiven ) . Either way satisfies the definition of a conflict stemming from problematic mindsets . Again , it is the purpose behind the throughline that is more important than its portrayal . <p> With Woody , an audience becomes personally familiar with the plight of someone not engaging in " playtime . " This lack of activity ripens any self-esteem issues a toy could possibly have and turns the conflict with Activity on its side . <h> The Entirety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with who they are , what they do , how they think or what they think , the Main Character gives writers the opportunity to explore conflict on a personal level . This unique quality , separate from the story-wide problem found in the Overall Story Throughline or the relational conflict found in the Relationship Throughline , draws an audience into a story . Without this unique perspective on conflict and the struggle to resolve it , the audience sits apart from the work in question , unable to emotionally invest themselves in the events on-screen or in type . <h> Stories That Fail to Engage <p> Consider recent emotionally-bereft pieces like Captain America . This latest disaster from Marvel had the best of intentions with its dork-to-champ story , yet for some reason tossed this personal throughline aside to focus on the silly tale of a red-masked Nazi and his super-weapon . If the authors did n't want to focus Cap 's story on the obvious Situational conflict ( weakling with muscles ) , they could have at least explored what happens when a superhero goes too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to seek out bullies and proactively seek revenge ? Certainly , and focusing his throughline on Problematic Activities would have solved this lack of emotional connection to the film . It would have called for an Influence Character with a Problematic Way of Thinking like Robert the Bruce or Buzz , but that 's an entirely different problem ! Regardless , an audience needs personal conflict in order to become engaged with a story . <p> Other vacant emotional tales ? Fast Five . The writers did n't even try , leaving this Summer dud one boring race car sequence after the next . Transformers : Dark of the Moon ? Like Captain America 's hero , at least Witwicki started out with some personal turmoil . True , Sam was only looking for a job , but at least it gave the audience something ! However , just like Cap , Witwicki 's personal conflict was soon overshadowed by mayhem and Dutch angles . <p> Even Mission Impossible 4 : Ghost Protocol , despite its phenomenal performance at the box office this season , failed to give audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare-doing atop the Burg Dubai was beyond exciting , yet without something personal to him for us to grab a hold of , his feats became more spectacle than meaningful . There was an effort to graft something on about his long-lost wife , but the exploration of this problem was so under-developed that the film post-Dubai dragged and plodded through its final Indian act . The fights were exciting , but without a well-defined personal conflict there was little reason to care or become emotionally invested . <h> Looking for Someone like Us <p> Is it perhaps reductive to isolate a Main Character 's Throughline to only one area of conflict ? Not if one understands the purpose of a throughline in defining the personality of a story . Effective stories reflect the problem-solving process of the human mind . To jump from one area to the next invites a sort of narrative schizophrenia that will only serve to confuse and frustrate the audience . <p> Anything is possible when it comes to art so yes , a writer could scatter the focus of a Main Character across several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees that the final product will not be something relatable except to those demented and irrational members of the audience . Audiences want stories that imitate those thought processes they are already so familiar with . The Main Character 's Throughline gives them that experience of I know exactly how he feels ... Anything less and that glowing exit sign becomes more of a lure than the images flickering on-screen . <p> December 31 , 2011 <h> Conflict of a Different Nature <p> In story , the forces of conflict arrange themselves in unique and natural patterns . When balanced properly , a story can deliver substance and meaning on a scale unheard of in lesser delivery mechanisms . <p> Beyond offering Authors insight as to why their stories might be struggling , this understanding also allows writers to infuse their work with an originality and purpose difficult to attain through mere muscle . Recognizing the most common patterns of conflict and sampling those not-so common patterns broadens the knowledge-base of those who work in narrative fiction while freeing their imagination to consider new possibilities . <h> The Same Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story structure as the best means towards creating a story of substance . Whether it be through a template of beats or a heroic journey from one world to the next , this advice aids the writer , yet never truly tells them as to why they should be adhering these ideas . Lacking a concrete explanation as to the meaning of these story points , the writer can do little more than follow along and hope for the best . More often than not , this approach leads to the same story , told in the same way , with little to no substance . <p> Contrast this sad result with the varied opportunities left open to writers who understand Dramatica 's concept of the Four Throughlines . As we have seen throughout this series , the order or beats that a story goes through pale in comparison to the power of focusing a story 's conflict on purposeful explorations of unique and connected throughlines . What there is to cover becomes far more important than hitting those beats . <p> With this approach , the writer can avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muse to create with intent . <h> Stories of Internal Struggle <p> Complete stories cover external and internal conflicts simultaneously . Certain parts of a story will focus on the efforts in the physical world , while others will emphasize the struggle within . Hollywood tends to favor the external struggle found in situations and activities . Why ? Visual medium , visual moments of conflict . Rarely do they venture inwards--such an act generally calls for a more ponderous medium . <p> In the article on exotic story structures , conversation centered around Main Characters with deficient ways of thinking . Both Red in The Shawshank Redemption and Hamlet in his self-titled play stood up as suitable candidates for this particular type of conflict . Yet in the big picture , these two stories explore different areas of conflict . <p> Shawshank tells the story of men consumed by an intolerable situation . Hamlet , on the other hand , tells the story of men ( and a woman or two ) consumed by their obsessions and the obsessions of others . Hamlet 's sustained grief for his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of overall story-wide conflict that comes from Problematic Fixed Attitudes . Conflict exists because of what everyone thinks , not because of their particular situation . Matched with Hamlet 's personal struggle over the way he thinks , this universal look at conflicting attitudes creates a story with a personality unlike any other . <p> Why are n't there more movies that take advantage of this unique setup ? <p> Communicating deficient psychologies and conflicting mindsets becomes somewhat of a challenge within the sparse confines of a screenplay . Stories that share this particular story " personality " --Amadeus and The Great Gatsby to name a few--stand out in mediums where the struggle over the internal can more readily play out . Novels and plays embrace the internal with a confidence Hollywood can not . Still , the convenience of that reality does not preclude the possibility of success . Amadeus did pretty well and continues to sit atop many of the " greatest films of all time " charts . For the adventurous and resolute screenwriter the challenge of visualizing the internal lies in wait . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle , this series on Conflict comes to an end . A comprehensive understanding of conflict and the throughlines that explore them met . Whether internal or external , state or process , every kind of inequity in the known Universe has its spot within the world of story . <p> But that 's just it ... <p> ... known Universe . <p> These areas of conflict are not real . They 're not tangible . They do n't exist as much as they stand for our own perceptions of what we observe and sense . As Melanie Anne Phillips , co-creator of Dramatica , is always fond of quoting , " The energy that flows through a system tends to organize that system " ( Buckminister Fuller ) --meaning these areas of conflict are built by our own minds . Our personal operating systems call for conflict to fall down these lines . Because we create these stories , it is only natural that they reflect our own internal thought processes . <p> Stories are models of our own minds at work . The foundation for Dramatica sits upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason why every story written with the theory or every story that fits easily into its framework feels complete and comprehensive . As audience members , we know how we think . Stories that honor that knowledge find a special spot in our hearts and in our minds . <p> If our minds evolve then this structural chart will have to transform as well . But for now , its accuracy stays unparalleled . <p> The structural chart--these four Areas of Conflict and the Throughlines that attach to them--are not a " system " for creating Hollywood blockbusters . They are not templates or elaborate plotting machines . They are reflections of ourselves . It just so happens that those stories that reflect us the best often become the ones we honor the most--with ticket sales and gold statues .

In this final article I want to show you how I take those previous exercises and fold them back in to my original story idea . <p> Now it just so happens that I came up with something stronger in terms of theme and character while working on the Playground Exercises . As a result , there is n't too much left of my original idea . In fact , the whole notion of this character being a murderer who did n't  know it fell away and will likely be an area I address with the Overall Story Throughline instead .

Like my students at the California Insititute of the Arts who would trash their year-long film project five weeks before the deadline , these novelists and screenwriters sense a lack of inequity with their story and subconsciously assume it means they should work on something else . They will challenge the veracity of the Playground Exercises or suggest an entirely new storyform . Its a crazy phenomenon that I have witnessed over and over again . Why does it happen ? <p> When writers write or filmmakers make , they 're caught up in the act of creation . They run into roadblocks or deadends , figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sequence , and then address the problems and move on . They assume that fixing story problems are an actual part of the process . But when you figure out your story ahead of time1 all those inequities of story structure and story meaning are resolved . You really have nothing more to figure out , except how you 're going to tell it . <p> This is what happens during this final phase of the Playground Exercise . <p> During this phrase , a writer must focus their energy on the storytelling aspect of their craft . Make it as interesting and compelling as possible , but do n't  lose all the work that has come before it . I cant tell you how many times writers spends weeks on their playgrounds only to completely forget them in the Combined Throughline phase .

Here they simply get to enjoy the act of writing , and it is scary . <h> A Playground for Writers <p> The idea of the Playground Exercises to infuse new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tons of time . The act of engaging in these exercises frees a writer from the shackles of their original ideaan idea that more often than not , is deficient for the task at hand .

They have it so good , being created in a lab rather than by biology " yet they still do n't  ever seem to be happy . Harley hates it so much so that he will lock himself within his slumber cubicle so that he wo n't have to hear it anymore . As a result , the workers around him fail to resolve their differences , the manufacturing line is a battleground , and Harleys ability to concentrate is shot .

As a result he died comfortablebut an unhappy comfortable . Harley still remembers the look on his fathers face when he told Harley that his life was a waste . That look of emptiness scares Harley so much that he refuses to invest himself fully into his work . <p> Domain &amp; Concern : So here you can see that I took the Influence Character Domain of Hating People Who Whine from Playground #3 and mixed it with the Concern of Remembering an Anniversary from Playground #5 .

The paranoia " while disruptive to the cityactually inspires great things in those older workers on their way out . A sanitation worker who used to delight in the sheer act of movement begins to dance in the early mornings at the end of her shift . A line manager who was originally taught to count stars in the sky returns his attention to the heavens and the wonders before himeven during work hours .

There is a certain amount of inertia that happens as you work through these exercises and the smaller more definite story points always seem to carry on a taste of the larger , broader story points above . But again , all I did was change the name . <h> Exploring Reality <p> Harley gets most charged when he witnesses workers consumed with the reality of day-to-day life .

I think that 's why these exercises are so powerful : by repeatedly hitting certain thematic chords , the vibrations work their way through you until the standing waves of your own truth resonate back .

If you understand Gists and the original Dramatica terminology they represent , this really is n't that difficult to do .

This runs contrary to the prevailing wisdom in modern storytelling . From screenwriting gurus to studio executives , a successful screenplay is thought to be one in which the principal characters in a story undergo significant change . But is that really true ? Must every character grow in such a way that they see the world through different eyes ? Partly yes , and partly no . <h> Growth and Resolve <p> My first stab at putting into words the difference between growth and change came with my article , Character Arc is Not All About Change .

Compare the way they are at the end of the film to the way they are at the beginning " if they 're a different person then they have " arc-ed " . If they are n't , then you 've got a problem with your story . This is where conventional understanding of a character arcing falls short . Powerful stories exist with characters who do n't follow this model of growth . <p> My understanding of story now is that you can split this concept of " arc-ing " into two separate items : Resolve and Growth . The idea being that you can have growth in a character while at the same time they maintain their resolve . Characters like this dig their heels in and bolster their courage in order to " stick to their guns . " There is no significant perspective change in this kind of character , but there is movement . In this way , you can have growth without significant change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they ultimately throw away their cherished beliefs and resolve to see the world in a different light . This would be the commonly accepted use of the term " arc " . <p> Deciphering between these two is not always as cut and dried as the above explanation . Especially if you come into contact with a wonderfully rich story . <h> Character Analysis of Surfs Up <p> Recently I had the extreme pleasure of finally seeing the Sony Pictures Animation film , Surf 's Up . For various reasons I had avoided it " the primary one being the fact that I was completely burnt out on penguin films at the time of its release . From afar I always appreciated the great sense of character design and knew of course , that the film was in good hands.2 But little did I know how wonderful the story would turn out to be . Looking beyond all the the witty , sincerely charming character moments one can find honest character development that is both meaningful and fulfilling.3 <h> The Two Principal Characters <p> When referring to characters arcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only talking about the two principal characters in a story . These should be the only two who experience significant emotional growth . The rest of the characters in the story need to remain static emotionally as they provide the logistical backdrop for these two to develop against . If other characters grow significantly , it 's safe to say that there is probably more than one story going on . Unfortunately , multiple stories in a single piece , especially within the confines of a 2-hour film , often result in incomplete and meaningless stories . <p> Thankfully this was n't a problem in Surf 's Up . <p> Without a doubt , the easiest part of this story to identify was the Main Character . If there is any character we are to empathize most with , the character through which we experience the story 's events , it would have to be Cody Maverick . From the very beginning we get a sense of what it is like to be in Cody 's world . Here we have the classic penguin-out-of-water story : a penguin with aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and bitter Antarctica . Voiced with charming sincerity by Shia LeBeouf , Cody rebuffs the scorn of his older brother and other penguins as he dreams of surfing in a championship like his hero , Big Z. <p> The other principal character in the story , the one with which Cody will share a deep and meaningful relationship with , is also easy to identify . Although there are moments when his role as that special character is handed off to Lani ( the " love interest " voiced by Zooey Deschanel ) , Big Z ( Jeff Bridges ) represents the character who has an alternate way of seeing things to Cody . The function of this character is to impact and influence the Main Character to grow in such a way that their personal viewpoint is challenged . Big Z fits that role perfectly . <p> But just exactly what kind of growth occurs is the most interesting part . <h> Misinterpretation of a Key Moment <p> In any complete story one of the principal characters will undergo a significant change in the way they see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the one that remains true to themselves wo n't undergo some degree of growth . Characters , like the people they 're often based on , must grow if there is to be any honesty in their portrayal . Stagnancy is death . But growth in a character is seen here separately from a complete change of heart . As defined earlier , one can grow in their resolve to stay devoted to the way they see the world . <p> So it was with this knowledge that I confidently approached my initial analysis of Surf 's Up . <p> At first , it was clear to me who changed and who remained steadfast . At the beginning of the film Cody is so excited about surfing that he tends to over-control everything . Cody was the kind of surfer who would force his way over any wave . He meets Big Z and as their relationship develops , Cody learns to stop trying to master every wave that comes his way . His climactic moment occurs during that wonderful point-of-view shot during the final race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focuses on simply riding the wavejust like Big Z taught him .

Not if you look deeper into what is really happening . <p> As that climactic wave builds in force and Cody begins to breathe harder and harder , voices from his past start voicing their disapproval , threatening to dissuade his resolve . And therein lies the key to what is really happening internally to Cody , and additionally the source of my initial error in analysis . Those voices were challenging his resolvehis initial drive to surf like a champion . Had he given up then yes , he would 've been a change character . But he did n't .

It 's only when he finally let 's go and trusts in something outside of himself that he ultimately finds the outcome he had always been searching for . <p> But unlike the stories of Luke and others with Main Characters who have undergone the same sort of " letting go " process , Surf 's Up still had more story to tell.4 That key moment with Cody on the surfboard was not the penultimate emotional moment that every story works towards .

Going against everything he stood for at the beginning of the story , Z heads out to save Cody from certain death . He has no idea how he 'll be received by the other penguins , but at that point he does n't care . <p> This is a significant emotional change in Big Z 's internal nature and represents a huge fundamental paradigm shift in the way he approaches the world . It 's no longer about winning or losing for Z , it 's how he plays the game .

" Words that Z once believed himself , but had forgotten in an effort to hide from certain shame . Cody takes every opportunity , whether consciously or not , to remind Z of his own inspirational words . Eventually he was transformed by them . <p> Every great story shares this dynamic : Two characters come into contact and influence each other in such a way that one 's worldview is significantly changed . Why do n't both change ? Because you measure the change in one by the steadfastness of the second .

Their former self will seem almost alien to them , as they now see the world through different eyes . <p> The other will behave the same whether we find them at the beginning , middle or end . The subtle difference is that now , at the end , their behavior will be a more informed one . They will have learned something , perhaps better coping skills or new techniques , but ultimately they will be going about things the same way . This is what it means to grow into one 's resolve ; to grow but to remain dedicated to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into change .

Whether done instinctively or because of something once read , most agree that this practice is both universal and helpful . <p> But what is left out of many of the discussions concerning Acts is why they even exist in the first place . Is it really simply a way of dividing a story up into Beginning , Middle and End as Aristotle believed thousands of years ago ? Or could there possibly be a more meaningful reason why stories naturally move through four distinct areas ? If one accepts the idea that stories are about solving problems , then the reason for Act divisions becomes clear . <h> Problem-Solving and Act Turns <p> The Inciting Incident occurs , introducing a problem into the lives of the characters who inhabit a story . In order to resolve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventual resolution of the problem , others are firmly against such an endeavor . The two forces battle it out until all the dramatic conflicts within that one particular approach are exhausted . If the problem continues to exist , a new approach must be taken , and thus , a brand new Act is required . <p> This is why Acts exist within a story . They signify the change in dramatic focus the characters take in order to solve the problems within a story . The reason there are only four acts in every complete story is because for every problem we can experience in our lives , there are four major contexts , or dramatic approaches , we can take in order to go about effective problem-solving . <h> Four Acts , Four Contexts <p> Let 's say , for example , that we are writing a story about a group of boxers and the challenges they face rising up through the amateur circuit . Their struggles come because they simply are n't very skilled boxers . Sure , they might have mental blocks or doubts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story is their prowess within the ring . <p> We want to write a complete story , and thus want to make sure that we cover all four contexts from which to examine this particular problem . When it comes to physical activities like this , the four basic contexts are DOING , OBTAINING , UNDERSTANDING and LEARNING . Once our boxers have moved through these four areas they will have explored every aspect of boxing from a physical standpoint and will have either found a way to solve their problem , or not . <p> The first , and probably most easy context to " get " is the context of actually DOING something . In this act , our group of boxers would explore the difficulties and conflicts created by body blows and uppercuts . The older more experienced boxers would challenge the younger ones and individual skill levels would be brought to test . There would be a lot of pain in this Act . <p> The second context would concern itself with OBTAINING something . Here , the group of boxers would perhaps duke it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who will go home with their tail tucked between their legs . There could be lives taken in this Act , if not arms broken , and falls taken for money . Anything and everything to do with achieving or losing something would fall into this category . <p> The third context deviates from the first two in that , at first glance , it seems to delve into more of a mental context . However , this is not so , as the struggle towards UNDERSTANDING something is truly a physical problem . In this act , the boxers would battle against their previous training , perhaps fighting their instincts to cover-up when their trainer wants them to open up instead . There would be accusations of cheating and confusion over one boxer 's proclivity to feint at the sight of blood . <p> See how our story is suddenly beginning to feel more full ? <p> Proponents of a three Act story structure would tell you that that is it , you 've covered the three basic movements--Beginning , Middle and End--and now it 's time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're experiencing right now ? That feeling that something is missing , or has yet to be covered ? That is the same feeling an audience experiences when a writer has failed to cover all four contexts . This is a feeling that should be avoided at all costs . <p> The fourth and final context of solving the physical problem of boxing comes with LEARNING something . Initially , it may be difficult to see the difference between this and the previous context , but if you think of Learning as the actual collecting of information and Understanding the act of making sense of it all , the differences should become apparent . <p> In this fourth Act , the boxers would learn new techniques , analyze film footage of previous bouts , and argue over what the line-up might be for the next tournament . They might discover one of them needs special treatment and spend late nights in the ring helping him out . They might even spy on the other group of amateurs across town . Anything to do with the struggles involved in the gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And with that , the story would now be complete . There would be no need to go back and show more scenes of fighting , or have yet another scene of someone losing their house because of their dedication to the sport . Those struggles , those contexts , have already been explored and movement has been made forward towards the ultimate resolution of the initial problem created by the Inciting Incident . To go back would be redundant , and completely unnecessary . <h> Problem-Solving At the Movies <p> As with the previous example regarding the group of boxers and the amateur circuit , the following film examples will focus primarily on the problems experienced by everyone in the story . Complete stories , especially films as wonderful as those below , are complex thematic explorations of different problems seen from many different points-of-view . In order to keep this article as focused and as simple as it can be , much of the more personal and heartfelt moments of each individual story will be left for another time . For now , we will hone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . <h> Star Wars <p> The major problem of Star Wars revolves around an Empire that has grown ruthless in its efforts to contain any rebellion . This problem begins with Darth Vader 's attack on Princess Leia 's ship and continues until the eventual destruction of the Death Star . <p> The First Act explores the fallout from Vader 's attack and the Rebel 's new Understanding of what it is they are dealing with now . The Act culminates with the Empire 's attack on the Jawas and Luke 's Aunt and Uncle . The Second Act finds the Rebels Learning the true destructive power of the Empire when the evil baddies test their weapon out on Alderaan . The Third Act has Luke and Co . Doing what they can to fight the Empire as it hunts down the hidden Rebel Base . And finally , the Fourth Act finds both good guys and bad guys fighting it out over who can destroy the other one first . <p> With this last Act , the story can end . Every context from which to examine an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand , then they were forced to learn , followed by actually doing something about it , and finally ending with winning and losing . Any further understanding or fighting would have required an entirely new story . Jumping from the Understanding to the Doing would have left the story feeling empty and hollow . <p> Four acts , four contexts from which to examine a problem . <h> Unforgiven <p> The major problem of Unforgiven surrounds a group of no-good assassins and their attempts to collect reward money for what many deem a reprehensible act . The problem begins with the Sheriff 's less-than-equitable punishment for the abuse of an innocent woman and ends with William Munny exacting revenge for those who decided to decorate their saloon with his friend . <p> The First Act finds the whores Understanding Little Bill 's warped sense of justice and their solution of offering up a reward for revenge . The Second Act turns with the arrival of English Bob and forces the Sheriff into teaching everyone what happens to killers and villains who come to Big Whiskey in search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act has William Munny and friends hunting down those responsible and Doing what they have to in order to collect the reward , especially when others ca n't . And finally , the Fourth Act forces Munny into exacting revenge upon his friend 's killers , killing whoever stands in his way ( Obtaining ) . <p> Once again , we have that feeling of completeness that comes from fully exploring every way to solve the problem at hand . If for some reason David Webb Peoples ( the screenwriter of Unforgiven ) had left out the conflict that comes when Ned ca n't Do what they came to do , the film would have felt less complete . It would have been similar to those times when someone leaves out a key portion of their argument , if only because it bolsters their position . The audience knows when a story " skips " over a key context in solving a problem . Exploring all four insures that the audience will leave satisfied . <h> Meaningful Plot Progression <p> Note that the Act order of this Academy-Award winning Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic , Star Wars . It starts with an Understanding that moves into Learning , then turns to Doing which eventually slides into Obtaining . Yet , is there anyone out there who would contend that these two films are the same ? <p> Story structure does n't and should n't dictate what kinds of scenes should show up in a story . It should n't require a " Call to Adventure " or a " Dark Night of the Soul " or any other simplistic interpretation of story structure that has no real meaning or hampers writers with the same kinds of scenes over and over again . It should , however , provide the necessary order of events needed to produce the kind of meaning an Author hopes to instill in the audience , leaving them plenty of room to write whatever their heart tells them . That is what happens when Acts are seen as progressive contexts for examining a problem . This is the way complete stories are written . <p> Both Star Wars and Unforgiven called for this plot progression of Acts because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different plot development depending upon the Author 's choice of certain structural and dynamic choices . In next week 's article we will cover other films that , although they explore the same four contexts of Understanding , Doing , Learning , and Obtaining , do so in a different order , thus producing a completely different kind of meaning . 209541 @qwx1069541 <p> Dramatica refers to these different contexts as Signposts . While the above explanation focused its attention on the Objective Story Throughline ( the throughline that considers everyone in the story , regardless of personal issues ) , there are other Signposts for each of the remaining three Throughlines ( Main Character , Impact Character , and Relationship Story Throughline ) . In this way , the problem that sits at the center of the story can be explored from every single perspective .

@@119273671 @8273671/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> In addition to actual concrete connections , there are forces of influence that bind the Main Character and Influence Character of a story together . <p> In last weeks article we took a look at Finding Connections Between the Two Principal Characters of a Story , the two principals being the Main Character and Influence Character . Starting at the top Domain level , we worked our way down illustrating the various story points that connect these two very important characters together . It is only once you reach the bottom Element level that those connections merge into more of an influence that is felt . <p> And here is where things get interesting . <p> The Main Character and Influence Character are not charactersthey are perspectives . More specifically they are points of view pointing towards the same thing . From the Main Characters perspective the inequity at the heart of the story appears one way . To the Influence Character this imbalance appears a completely different way . The Main and Influence Characters are not looking at two separate things that have some connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why you get conversations like " You and I are both alike " or " Were nothing alike ! " It all depends if you are talking about the thing you are looking at or where you are looking from . To add another level of connection between these perspectives would obfuscate and dilute the structure of the model . <p> It would also be another attempt to illicit meaning from a model built on prediction . <h> No Meaning From What Will Be <p> As mentioned in the article The Veil Between Author and Audience , authors run into trouble the moment they try to find meaning in their predictions . I get it . You see Dramatica , you love all the insights and revelations it brings to something you already intuitively felt on some level , and you want to know what it all means . <p> But that meaning comes after you have written the story and after you have arranged all the various points of character and plot and theme and genre in such a way that there should be some meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the actual meaning in it . <p> This explains why so many people have trouble with Dramatica . They are used to the Heros Journey and Save the Cat ! and My Story Can Beat Up Your Story and all the other countless paradigms out there because those methods of appreciating story look to the meaning of things . They appeal to the artist within and the human mind that longs to be understood . Dramatica looks from the Authors perspective and shows how to predict how an audience will feel or react . It does n't  supply meaning . <p> That is why some Authors have a distaste for the theory . <p> Prediction is where the story points of Story Outcome and Story Judgment come into play . Give an Audience a Success/Good ending and you can predict that the audience will feel triumphant as in Short Term 12 or Finding Nemo . Give them a Success/Bad ending and you can predict they will feel a personal tragedy as with Lord of the Flies or Memento . This is , of course , assuming that nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of digital medium to audience . If all goes well , an author can reasonably assume that an audience will behave a certain way based on these story points . <p> This prediction of meaning is built into the model . Story Outcome and Story Judgment set gears and levers deep within Dramaticas story engine and determine things like the order of Signposts within various Throughlines . It is n't as if Chris and Melanie discovered Story Outcome and Story Judgment and asked , What does it mean ? They set out to define the various combination of ingredients that Authors put together in order to foretell possible meaning . <p> Still , there are structural connections elsewhere that find the Main and Influence Characters tied together by a Dynamic Pair relationship . <p> Here at the Element or character level , we do n't  see a direct dynamic pairing the original question thought might exist , but rather an influence that is felt through the shared elements carried by the Overall Story Throughline . <h> A Bridge between Connection and Influence <p> Think of the Overall Story Throughline as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The character who changes their resolve will share the same Problem and Solution elements with the Overall Story . The character who remains steadfast in their resolve shares the Symptom and Response with the Overall Story . Why ? <p> The Steadfast character handles the work needed to solve the problem , the Change character manages the dilemma created by the problem . This work/dilemma relationship is a dynamic pairing seen in the process of human problem solving . It works as both an influence and a connection between the two Throughlines . The one doing the work influences the one facing the dilemma and vice-versa . <p> In The Sixth Sense both Malcom Crowe ( Bruce Willis ) and the majority of the characters in the story suffer from a shared Problem of Perception . This makes Malcom the Changed character and therefore the principal character dealing with the dilemmaeither continue to fool yourself into thinking one way or look to what Actually is going on . Match that up with everyone else dealing with their own false Perceptions of Cole Sear ( Haley Joel Osment ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Actuality ) and you can begin to see where these two Throughlines flow into one another . <p> But then take a look at the Symptom of Aware and the Response of Self-Aware in both the Overall Story Throughline and the Influence Character Throughline . This is why Cole is charged with the work of the narrative : his awareness is the superficial problem everyone else is dealing with as well . The response of Self-Aware can be seen in the therapy sessions and the efforts of the ghosts to make themselves known to the living . <p> Malcom deals with the dilemma , Cole handles the work . Both influence each other and challenge each other based on their individual approaches . <p> Note that in some stories , the work is the right approach to bringing about a successful resolution .

If I had a complete storyform then said , " Oh , the conflict between the IC and the MC is X " where X had no direct relationship to any particular element in the storyform , would n't that be completely undermining the storyform itself ? <p> The conflict between the Influence Character and the Main Characteris X , where X is the Throughline .

You cant , therefore , point to one thing and say this is where they differ on approach in the same way that you cant define that actual inequity that is driving the entire narrative . An inequity , or conflict , in Dramatica terms is a separateness between two things . That separateness between the two Throughlines is where they differ in approach . <p> There is no such thing as an MC without an IC . You need both to actually have a problem and conflict to work through . And you can articulate that approach by articulating the Throughlines . <h> Using the Model as Intended <p> Writers cant help themselves . They want meaning . Why else would they be writing if it werent to establish some better understanding of the world they see ? The original question posed by the writer sought to understand the meaning behind two elements of structure purposefully designed not to have meaning . <p> The connections seen and influences felt between the Main Character and Influence Character do describe the approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human mind in the process of problem-solving . You need both work and dilemma to accurately describe that process . <p> One could conceivably find some meaning by looking to example films and novels and try to determine the meaning of the various problem elements .

The meaningas if with all meaningwould be open to subjective interpretation and subject to all kinds of personal bias and conditioning . <p> There is no secret recipe to how these elements connect beyond their original intended purpose . Dramatica is a model of human-problem solving and as such , offers writers an opportunity to present their stories in a way that matches how we ourselves seek to resolve the inequities in our lives .

The film makes the painfully egregious error of trying to make both principal characters change fundamentally . The concept that what a character wants is not necessarily what they " need " is often used in some circles to describe the reason for a characters arc . Whether or not basing an entire films message on what can be found in any rudimentary screenwriting book is appropriate could be argued , but the concept is basically correctfor Prince Naveen . A good-for-nothing womanizing Prince who finds that hard work is its own reward is a nice and solid character arc that describes a fundamental Change . But when that concept is forced onto the Main Character , all meaning is lost . <p> If the story had been structured correctly , hard-working Tiana would set out on her impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act by act until at the end she is left with a single choice : continue on with her now really impossible dream or change to be more like Prince Naveen .

Instead she chooses love ( or a mixture of both , it really is unclear ) and in doing so becomes more like Prince Naveenlazy , and dare I say , shiftless . To buy into the idea that she now loves this frog because he chopped some vegetables and danced with her ( something he probably did with countless women before ) is preposterous at best , and thus makes her choice less of a noble one and more of one based on the realization that she can probably get what she wants without having to work hard for it . After all , her Prince will buy the restaurant for her !

From there , it would be only a matter of time before the money would start flowing . <p> Probably not the message they were going for . <p> Add on to this countless other structural errors and the film becomes a meaningless mess . Killing off the Antagonist before the problems in the Overall Story throughline have been resolved ( returning the frogs to their human form ) creates that " When is this ever going to end ? " syndrome . When it finally does end with Prince Naveen kissing the Princess ( an action ) , its of a different type than the Inciting Incident that started the problems in the first place ( Prince Naveens decision to let Facilier do his thing ) . The order of events has meaning . The Inciting Incident and Closing Event need to be of the same type - either a decision or an action , but not both . <p> Prince Naveen though , is too late with his kiss and the efforts to resolve the problems in the Overall Story end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Story Fanatic column as rarely , if ever , do animated films end in a Personal Triumph .

Along with this greater focus on accuracy , however , comes the responsibility of making allowances for deeply held beliefs over how and why a story operates . <p> No greater does this responsibility make itself known than in the argument over whether or not certain characters change within a story . Dramatica , the first iteration of Narrative Science , seems to only call for one major character to change . How can that be when one considers stories like Toy Story , The Sixth Sense and Pride and Prejudice where it seems both principal characters change ? <p> Counter-intuitive as this must seem in light of these examples , an effective story demands it . <h> A Rule That Supports Meaning <p> As covered in the previous article A Reason for Rules , an effective story proves the Author 's argument by featuring two principal characters with conflicting perspectives on how best to solve the story 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rational and emotional outcome . If the one that " wins " ends up bringing everyone to triumph , then the Author has successfully argued for the efficacy of that winning perspective . If instead the winning approach leads to tragedy , then the Author has argued that that perspective was most inappropriate . <p> Authors use the perspectives of the two central characters to prove their take on the world . <h> A Change of Resolve , Not a Change of Growth <p> Dramatica 's first story point deals specifically with the perspective of one of these principal characters--the Main Character . Referring to this bit of story structure as the Main Character 's Resolve , it simply asks whether the Main Character Changes or Remains Steadfast in their resolve . In other words , has the Main Character stayed consistent within their worldview ( Steadfast ) or have they " flipped " , and completely adopted a whole new way of seeing things ( Change ) ? <p> As an aside--and another " rule " of story structure--whatever the Main Character 's final Resolve happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Influence Character , will seemingly share the opposite resolve . More on this in just a bit . <p> Luke Skywalker in Star Wars , Rick in Casablanca and Ralph from Wreck-It Ralph all clearly adopt a brand new way of seeing things . They shed the old for the new . <p> But Dr. Richard Kimball ( Harrison Ford ) from The Fugitive , Ray Kinsella ( Kevin Costner ) from Field of Dreams , and Anna Khitrova ( Naomi Watts ) from Eastern Promises clearly do n't behave in this manner . Instead of growing by transferring their point-of-view to another track , they stand their ground and grow by remaining true to what they hold most dear . <p> These Main Characters grow , but they do n't change their mindset . Change as Dramatica sees it speaks of adopting a brand new point-of-view--one that requires eschewing all remnants of the past . Still , even with this explanation firmly in mind many struggle with the idea that of some Main Characters not changing . <h> A Problem of Semantics <p> Unfortunately Dramatica runs into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story structure actually works often requires a redefining of some terms previously taken for granted . The concept of Protagonist works in a general sense , but when delineating the objective perspective of the Overall Story from the personal first-person perspective of the Main Character , the common general approach muddles the Author 's argument ( For more on this , please see Redefining Protagonist and Main Character ) . When answering Dramatica 's structural questions or trying to determine a certain aspect of your story 's structure , you have to know what it is you are actually looking at . <p> But perhaps this use of the word " Change " and applying it to only one of the principal characters becomes too much . It may be the most accurate way to describe the process of a fully-functioning story , but it might also be creating confusion where there should n't be . Like many of the terms found in earlier versions of Dramatica such as Preconscious and Obstacle Character ( now Impulsive Responses and Influence Character respectively ) , a slight modification might be in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not a character has changed or remained steadfast , perhaps we should be asking if their initial perspective has stayed consistent throughout the end of the story or has it been transferred or rejected , or even better--has it " flipped " ? Instead of Main Character Resolve : Change or Steadfast , perhaps Main Character Perspective : Consistent or Flipped . In this way we drop the rather-charged word of " change " from the equation and make it easier for Authors and analysts to define where and when a story needs fixing . <p> More importantly though , we should drop the idea that the converse is true ( if the Main Character stays consistent the Influence Character will flip ) . Why ? Because stories define Influence Characters by their impact on the Main Character , not by how their perspectives have changed personally for themselves . Structurally speaking we do n't jump into their shoes the same way we do with the Main Character . From the vantage point of the Main Character it 's not important whether or not the Influence Character 's Perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not their influence over the Main Character has stayed consistent or grown irrelevant . <h> Greater Understanding <p> With this in mind the problems concerning the dynamics between the Main and Influence Characters in Toy Story , The Sixth Sense and Pride and Prejudice quickly fade away . <p> In Toy Story it seems as if Woody changes . How else would one interpret his ability to share the top spot on the bed with another toy ? Yet , if one dives deep into the structure of this great film clarity shines through . Woody does n't change his point-of-view , he matures into it . " It does n't matter how much we 're played with--what matters is that we 're here for Andy when he needs us " describes his initial perspective . That belief grows throughout the film until it becomes so strong he is willing to sacrifice everything to be there for Andy . <p> If Woody had shed his identity as Andy 's toy and somehow became as delusional as Buzz then yes , he would have been considered a Change character . Change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixth Sense and Elizabeth from Pride and Prejudice operate this way . They both reject their initial perspectives . Malcom sees things for how they really are and Elizabeth agrees to marry the man she promised she never would . Looking at their respective Influence Characters Cole and Mr. Darcy , we begin to see the importance of indentifying their influence over their respective Main Characters and where that ultimately ends up . <p> In The Sixth Sense Cole may see things personally in a different light , he may have seemingly " changed " but when it comes to his actual influence over Malcom , it 's still there in the end . He may understand what it is the ghosts want from him and he may be finally facing his fears , but that influence he has over Malcom--that stubborn denial of peer pressure and verbal attacks against his character--that 's still there as well . He puts up with everyone thinking him a " freak " because he sees things others do n't , an attitude that ultimately influences Malcom to open up his own eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man in question may have endeavored to prove how much he is willing to change for Elizabeth , but his pride and general demeanor which held influence over her did not become wholly irrelevant . Why else would her father still question her final decision if he did not still sense that sense of pride within Mr. Darcy ? His quality of character may have subdued a little by taking a different direction , but it was not rejected outright . <p> Contrast these instances of consistent influence with those of Sam Gerard ( Tommy Lee Jones ) , Terrence Mann ( James Earl Jones ) , and Nikolai Luzhin ( Viggo Mortensen ) from The Fugitive , Field of Dreams , and Eastern Promises . These characters grow in such a way that their influence ultimately becomes inconsequential to their respective Main Characters . Gerard 's " I do n't care " turns into " I care enough to keep the Police from killing you . " Mann 's refusal to open the door to his own apartment turns into a willingness to step into the unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby and ultimately Anna herself . <p> All of these reflect instances where the actual influence upon the Main Character to question their own way of seeing things essentially vanished . By becoming inconsequential , these characters solidified the stalwart resolve of the counterparts . <h> Change Clouds the Meaning within a Story 's Structure <p> To search for change within a story 's structure only befuddles the observer . Change is everywhere . The change from one Act 's Signpost to another , the change within the Story Limit as time runs out or options disappear , and yes , the change within the Main Character as they grow to a point where their resolve comes into question . <p> Talented writers know change must happen , they know their characters must grow else the story lie dormant and dead . To tell these same writers that only one principal character actually changes while the other remains steadfast runs counter to their instincts and fuels the fire for the inaccuracy of Dramatica and Narrative Science as a whole . Better to quantify and clarify what the storyform actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By seeking instead for the consistency or " flipping " of the Main Character 's perspective , writers and analysts close the story structure book on this issue of changing or not changing . In addition , by understanding the true role of the Influence Character within the structure of a story and how it is their influence that should be judged , not their personal resolve , and understanding of how these two perspectives work together to define the meaning of a story , writers and analyst can confidently get back to the work of creating fully functional and purposeful stories .

The idea was to provide a brief understanding of how a character arc works in Dramatica and how thinking of an arc this way is vastly superior to anything else out there . And do it all in less than two minutes . <p> With Dramatica , you can actually identify the exact Element that drives your Main Characters growth and determine what Element they " arc " to . So instead of pining on and on about inner conflicts and outer conflicts and wants and needs , you can quickly and easily focus in on what is really causing your Main Character trouble and then develop a way for them to work out of it ( or into it , as the case may be ) . <p> Dramatica gives writers the ingredients to make a great storyunlike every other understanding of narrative out there that tells you how a great story tastes ( Save the Cat ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story Steps , etc . ) . <p> While editing the latest class Melanie and I gave on Learn Characters in a Day last month , I discovered these old gems .

The film is missing two major components of the minds problem-solving process . This is not supposition . <h> But Isnt All Analysis Simply Subjective Opinion ? <p> Not necessarily . Consider this criticism : the idea that Hanna is the sole survivor of a CIA genetics program to grow super soldiers is a cheezy one .

" <p> They would be wrong , but they could do it and the eventual argument that would follow would have us both running around in circles proclaiming our own opinions with no impact on the other . <p> Why not allow Hannas bad-ass fighting skills to be simply the result of sixteen years of secluded training with her father ? Isnt that what the trailer sold us ? Ahh , but I digress <p> Subjective opinions . And we all know what opinions are like ( and the part of the human anatomy they most resemble ) . Everyone has one , right ? <p> But what about the film in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> The Emotional Argument <p> Hanna ( Saoirse Ronan ) is the Main Character of this story . We experience the story through her , our empathy lies with her , and we are privy to her personal issues that no one else is aware of . <p> Sheltered for sixteen years mere miles from the Arctic Circle , Hanna knows nothing of fluorescent lights , of TVs , of helicopters , and of tea kettles . Her personal journey is that of someone trying to understand the world around them and trying to maintain control over finely-tuned instincts that say danger lurks around every corner . <p> To challenge her , the story needs a character who maintains a different worldview , someone who can come along and say , Hey , you 're not seeing things the right way . This challenging viewpoint drags the Main Character out of the morass of their personal justifications ( or Backstory ) and forces them to face themselves . <p> At first glance it seems like this character is already there in Hanna . From the start the young girl on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with appearances and boys , seems to offer Hanna a different way of seeing things .

The bookend scenes with the stag at the beginning and Marissa ( Cate Blanchett ) at the end show the Audience that while this girl has grown , she has returned to the life set for herthat of a hunter and trained assassin . <p> The cold-hearted way in which she delivers the line " I missed your heart " suggests a Personal Tragedy .

It may have left her feeling personally unresolved and " down " ( the tragedy part ) , but it resolved the problems in the story at large .

It happened in Chinatown . It happened in Silence of the Lambs . And it happened in Romeo and Juliet . All of these stories , Hanna included , show a Main Character who ended up down a dark path by holding on to their own personal issues . In return , the character who challenged themNancy , Hanibal Lecter , and Julietfundamentally changed their personal point-of-view of the world .

Someone with a plan . Someone who challenged Hanna with their own concept of the way the world should be . <p> Someone like Marissa . <h> Character Clues into the Storys Problem <p> Besides the storytelling fact that they have a tremendous actress with which to effectively carry the emotional argument , Marissa already comes primed with several key characteristics that fit in perfectly with the storys structural argument . The meticulous detail with which she organizes her dental tools . The clean lines on her gray skirt . The way she wears her hair and the precision with which she applies her lipstick . These are all signs of a character driven by order , a character who needs things to be neat and tidy for life to be comfortable . <h> Changing Order into Chaos <p> If the Authors were to consider Marissa for this important role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film driven by chaos . Why ? If you have order on one side of a character who needs to alter the way they see things , chaos would naturally sit on the other side . <p> In other words , Marissa would start out keeping things neat and tidy , and then by virtue of her interaction with Hanna would end up chaotic and disorganized . It sort of is there with her stumbling through the amusement park , but it is n't made a point of , it is n't the end line of a characters development . It feels more like an interesting location to film the ending of a film rather than a location that supports a characters natural development , or arc . <h> Meaningful Reasons for a Characters Actions <p> Take for instance the idea that Marissa was keeping the Galinka file ( the program Hanna was in ) in a safe . Why did n't  she destroy it years ago ? Why wait now to burn it ? Without any structural impetus for Marissa to behave the way she does , her actions seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Consider instead that she had this problem with keeping things manageable.Perhaps she could never dispose of a file until she was certain all elements were taken care of and disposed of . Perhaps that was the way she always had to have projects work out . Wouldnt her burning of the file now make more sense ? <p> In fact , instead of simply burning it , it should have been a more chaotic event . Other files , other programs ripped out of the safe so she could reach that one . A mad dash for the lighterbut she cant find it , so she grabs the box of matches . Rips those open and they spill out all over the counter . She finds one and madly lights it . <p> Now this moment says something about her character . It says something about her characters development . No longer concerned with organization and precision , Marissa simply wants the job done , whatever it takes . <h> Development Leading into the Storys Conclusion <p> So Marissa would end the film deranged . Her hair a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And these actions would pour into the rest of the story . Innocent civilians hurt . Buildings destroyed . Pandemonium in the streets . In a wordchaos . <p> This would lead to her downfall and Hannas triumph as Protagonist . The young assassin could still have her line about how she missed Marissas heart , but now it would mean something . The actions of this steadfast hunter would have driven this calm cool CIA operative stark raving mad . <h> A Good Place to Start <p> There is more , but this would have put the film on the right course . There would still need to be a relationship developed between Marissa and Hanna . Perhaps it could venture into a surrogate mother/daughter relationship and all the issues that would go along with that . Either way , it would have to be in there in order for the argument to be complete . <p> True , it would be a bit too easy to have Marissa assume this structural position when taking into account her role as Antagonist . Typically writers separate these two into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story feel " lightweight . " But in this case , when the focus is on running and fighting and more running , the smallness of the argument might call for it . <h> Avoiding Obscurity <p> Hanna did n't  alter her approach . Neither did Marissa . This is where the structure of the story breaks down . One character needs to change the way they see the world , the way they approach and solve problems . If everyone keeps going down the same path , there is no meaning supplied to the audience , no message about effective problem-solving . <p> This is the reason why a film like Hanna becomes quickly forgettable . There was nothing said beyond the flash and style of the finished product . Sure , we could focus our criticism on cheezy super-solder storylines , but we would n't be addressing the real problems with the construction of the films story . <p> For a story to become timelessto sit within the minds of an Audienceit must show the problem-solving processes within every Audience member . <p> Anything else is merely conjecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanna by Ability seems to be obvious indicators of Hannas storyform . The Overall Story Throughline of an open-ended CIA program fits squarely in Situation . Hanna , as a clear Do-er , and someone struggling with her own concerns of Understanding fits well in Activity . <p> Seeing that the Impact Character Problem was Order and sensing that Marissa should have played a bigger role in the storys structure , the idea that she should have been the Impact Character becomes super obvious . Why create a brand new character if steps were already taken ( perhaps subconsciously ? ) to have her play that role ? <p> If this werent a finished film and there was time for more drafts , there could be a focus on the problematic relationship between Hanna and Marissaa Fixed Attitude between the two centering on a concern of Memory . ( Perhaps conflicting memories of how mother died , of how father reacted in the days after , the Truth about who cared for her more , etc. )

I absolutely loved every frame of this show ; a sentiment reinforced by my desire to start over with Episode One and binge-watch the entire thing all over again . As with the novel All the Light We Can not See and the foreign film The Lives of Others , Stranger Things connects with a sophistication that places it in the hallowed Hall of the Heroes.1 <p> What is n't timeless are the countless 80s references and scenes inspired by 80s movies . The bond between Stranger Things and E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial exists as most prominent : pre-teen kids shelter someone " or something " wanted by a mysterious government agency . Funny than , that I should complete the series on the heels of our deep Dramatica thematic analysis of E.T . last week . <h> The Drive to Pursue , the Drive to Avoid <p> E.T ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our planet . Stranger Things ends in success because the kids stand up and pursue the monsters behind the Upside Down ( both super-dimensionally and dimensionally ) . <p> In Dramatica we see the Overall Story Problem of E.T . " the inflection point of conflict that motivates each and every sceneas being Pursuit . Keys and the Government pursue E.T . and E.T . pursues a path towards phoning home . Without this drive to pursue there would be no conflict in the movie . <p> The dynamic opposite to Pursuit is Avoidance . When one identifies the Problem of a Throughline , one simultaneously calls out the Solution of that Throughline . The conflict in E.T finds motivation in Pursuit , yet discovers resolution in Avoidance ( running away from or escaping ) . <p> The flow from Problem to Solution in the Overall Story Throughline for the first season of Stranger Things moves in the opposite direction . The Government tries to prevent anyone from finding out about 11 or the tear in the space-time continuum while the boys do everything they can to keep anyone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides to prevent and avoid there would be no conflict in the series . <p> In the next to last episode of the series , the boys find themselves pedalling for safety as members of an unidentified Government Agency chase after them . The scene bears a striking resemblance to the climactic scene in E.T. , one so strong that a prediction as to the eventual outcome of that scene seems inevitable : 11 will lift the boys and their bikes into the air . <p> But she does n't  . <p> The reason she does the exact opposite thing E.T . did lies in this difference between Overall Story Problems . Mike and the others need Pursuit to resove their conflict " they need someone to stand up and fight against these " bad men . " Elliott and his friends need Avoidance " they need someone to lift them up in the air to the accompaniment of one of John Williams greatest scores of all time . <h> Confidence in the Conflict <p> I love Stranger Things . And I love E.T . The thing with the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film and why I dedicated my whole life to great stories . Because they matter . In fact , I recently tweeted about the show : <p> I love Stranger Things so much . It makes me want to read Stephen King novels , ride a bike , and play D&amp;D . <p> The key to writing a great , compelling story that outlasts you and everyone else who works with you is finding the conflict that really lies at the heart of your narrative . Like the difference between Luke and Neo , stark differences exist between the Overall Stories of supposedly similar stories . Superficially Stranger Things seems like an updated homage to E.T. , but deep down underneath it all the truth reads stranger than fiction . <p> You just need to start thinking like the flea , instead of the acrobat.

Most animated films place the Main Character Throughline in Situation , the Influence Character Throughline in Fixed Attitude , the Overall Story Throughline in Activity , and the Relationship Story Throughline in Manipulation , or Way of Thinking . <p> Zootopia did not . <p> In fact , this is such a consistent alignment in almost every Disney , Dreamworks , and Pixar film that during the recording of this weeks Narrative First Podcast I had trouble deciphering where the Main Character Throughline landed for Zootopia . I had expected Situation as was the custom and seemed appropriate for the first bunny rabbit to be a cop . But she clearly dealt with her own subconscious racist attitudes towards the end of film which would have her in Fixed Attitude . <p> Turns out she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vinne of Vander Vinne Studios , I finally saw why the film worked for so many people and what I was missing . Mark suggested the alignment you will find below , one that in retrospect seems so blatantly obvious . <p> The conflict in Hopps personal Throughline does n't  stem solely from her fixed Situationeveryone is dealing with a problematic situation in some sort of fashion or another . Instead , it is her Activities , her attempts at Doing something that no other rabbit has done before that is the source of her difficulties and something that is unique to her , and her alone . That is the definition of a Main Character Throughline . <p> This puts Nick the Fox in Manipulation and focuses his Concern on Playing a Role ; in other words , playing the hand that he has been dealt . * " Everyone comes to Zootopia , thinking they could be anything they want . But you cant . You can only be what you are . Sly fox . Dumb bunny . " This Way of Thinking is just the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference in the world . Nick has achieved some level of success with this particularly bleak viewpoint of the worldperhaps she should too . <p> At this , the " personality " level of the dramatic structure , Zootopia shares a similar narrative drive to last weeks Throughline Thursday , Beasts of No Nation . A Main Character struggling with Activities who is challenged to grow because of the subtle and not-so-subtle Manipulations of an Influence Character . <p> But the similarities end there , for rather than explore the external fixed state of affairs that Beasts of No Nation does , Zootopia examines the deep-seeded Fixed Attitude , or racism , inherent within the instincts of an animal . These Impulsive Responsesthe impulse to pull a child close on a bus , or carry " Fox-spray " wherever you goare the sources of conflict in the Overall Story Throughline . <p> The arrangement of Throughlines determine the personality or Genre of the narrative being explored . These Patterns of Conflict have the largest impact on how a story will feel to an audience . That is why so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Overall Story in Fixed Attitude naturally encourages the Relationship Story Throughline into Situation which again feels perfect for the story we were presented . A fox and a rabbit forced into working with one another . Both have reasons for distrusting the other because of who they are externally , who they are on the outside . Overcoming that distrust rests at the heart of their relationship . <p> While Zootopia still has an issue with its broken Story Limit , the Throughlines come across strong and purposeful . A bold choice to explore an Overall Story in Fixed Attitude , particularly within the context of an animated film built for a Western audience . It is something you would only expect to find in an Eastern animated film , like When Marnie Was There . Hopefully this is a sign of greater and more imaginative storytelling to come .

Not sure about the format of putting a blockquote within a blockquote , but here it goes with a piece on storytelling and poet Jane Hischfield from July of this year : <p> But the aspect of concentration perhaps most widely relevant beyond poetry is that of narrative " our supreme hedge against the entropy of existence . Hirshfield writes : Storytelling , like rhetoric , pulls us in through the cognitive mind as much as through the emotions . It answers both our curiosity and our longing for shapely forms : our profound desire to know what happens , and our persistent hope that what happens will somehow make sense . Narrative instructs us in both these hungers and their satisfaction , teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the arc of lives . If shapeliness is an illusion , it is one we require " it shields against arbitrariness and against chaos 's companion , despair . And story , like all the forms of concentration , connects .

The Dramatica storyform organizes and holds the message of the meaning . Using it as a guide aids the Author in combatting lifes " arbitrariness " by delivering a message of " deepened coherence . " <p> If Popovas purpose would is to find the meaning behind the connections , then an elevated understanding of Dramatica and its unique take on the elements of story may prove to be the very last puzzle piece . <p> And finally , a quote for all lovers of great narrative : <p> Story remains a basic human path toward the discovery and ordering of meaning and beauty .

Some grow by maintaining their resolve against all odds . <p> When asked to define character arc , most people think it has something to do with how the Main Character changes within a story . While in some respect this is correct , it is inaccurate to assume that this means every Main Character needs to undergo some major transformation . Understanding the difference between growth and change is essential to the proper implementation of character arc in a story . <p> Without a doubt , Main Characters need to grow . A story can not develop organically if the principal characters within it do not grow and adapt to the shifting dramatic tides .

And were not talking about weak stories or stories that have problems . Amadeus , The Silence of the Lambs , Chinatown , the list goes on and on . These are fantastic stories that are on the top of every Top 100 list . Non-transformative growth can be a powerful means of expressing an authors point-of-view . <p> Again , understanding the difference between growth and change is the key . Not all growth requires a different mindset . As the video above clearly shows , there is great meaning to be found in stories where a characters " arc " requires them to stand their ground .

Or they may be rocketing through space instead of riding horses through Monument Valley . Still , something about the overall feeling of the experience screams familiarity . <p> Ever watch Finding Nemo and start hallucinating that Marlin is the Jamie Foxx character from Collateral and Nemo is Tom Cruise ? No ? What about Back to the Future ? Ever notice how Shrek is Marty and Fiona is Doc ? Still no ? You cant see how Shrek and Marty both have to fight against others preconceptions of them and how Doc and Fiona stop running away and start pursuing a course of resolution in the end ? <p> Too complicated ? <p> Let 's start with some simpler , more obvious examples of familiar storytelling . Everyone knows West Side Story as a remake of Romeo and Juliet . Warring families and star-crossed lovers permeate both narratives with each finding resolution in the unravelling of its lead character . Tony and Romeo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many also understand Bridget Jones Diary as a modern re-telling of Pride and Prejudice The former wastes little time pretending to be anything other than a reinterpretation of the Jane Austen Classic . The evidence ? Both tell a story where temptation drives the efforts of characters to better their station in life . If that werent enough Helen Fielding , the novelist behind Bridget Jones , named her romantic lead Darcy , even going so far as to describe him like Colin Firth ( who portrayed Austens Darcy in the 1996 BBC version ) . <p> Adaptations and remakes naturally rest on common thematic ground . They 're telling the same story after all . But what about those stories that end up supported on the same foundation without even meaning to do so ? <h> The Form Behind Narrative <p> The Dramatica storyform holds the message of a narrative . Seventy-five different , yet connected , points of story communicate the intent of an Author to the Audience . Unlike other paradigms that see narrative as different takes on the same story ( usually heroic ) Dramatica sees well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only the current model . The theory of Dramatica contends that there could be 4x that number of specific storyforms beyond the current Western-biased model . They would require further research and development to identify , but theoretically they exist . <p> Ignoring those for the time being , Dramaticas current ability to single out 32,000+ helps to provides us with a comprehensive and functional model of how stories work . It also grants us insight into the similarities between films , novels and plays that on the surface , seem to explore different thematic material . And occasionallybut less often than many would have you believeDramatica identifies narratives that have the same exact structural makeup , regardless of genre or intent . <h> Unforgiven and The Terminator <p> Turns out James Camerons 1984 sci-fi thriller and Clint Eastwoods 1992 Oscar Western share the same thematic endoskeleton . Both The Terminator and Unforgiven feature a plot of revenge to take lives ( Overall Story Goal of Obtaining ) and showcase a Main Character who learns that stepping up and preventing others from doing things actually solves problems ( Main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an Overall Story Outcome of Success ) . William Munny and Sarah Connor would rather work their personal problems out internally ( Main Character Approach of Be-er ) which makes things difficult as the story itself requires external action to get things moving ( Story Driver of Action and Story Tendency : Unwilling ) . And both probably wished they had stayed home as the end of their respective stories leaves gunfighter and waitress in a bad place ( Story Judgment of Bad ) . <p> The similarities in thematic content continue . Kyle Reese and Ned Logan challenge their Main Characters to grow in similar fashion ( Influence Character Throughline ) . Each bring up concerns of what will beKyle with his doomsday scenario and Ned with the financial struggles of a farmer ( Influence Character Concern of *The Future ) Both bring up issues of staying open to the possibilities of what could beKyle with his affection for Sarah and willingness to travel across space and time to be with her , and Ned with his openness towards going on the mission when he just finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get some upstairs with one of the house ladies ( Influence Character Issue of Openness ) . When you have a story driven by the pursuit of revenge that centers around a character who ends up completely changing how he or she solves problems , you need a character like Ned or Kyle to bring them there . No other catalyst will suffice . <h> Kung Fu Panda and Erin Brockovich <p> What possibly could the stories of an overweight Panda bear and a badly-behaved amateur lawyer have in common ? More than one would have guessed . Both Kung-Fu Panda and Erin Brockovich present Main Characters defined and saddled by their outwardly appearance ( Main Character Throughline of Situation ) . Creating problems for themselves by refusing to back down from their passion to help others , both computer-generated and real-world personalities ultimately find redemption for their actions ( Main Character Problem of Help , Main Character Resolve of Steadfast , and Story a Judgment of Good ) . Unlike William Munny and Sarah Connor above , Erin and Po cant wait to participate in the storys events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to get things done ( Story Tendency of Willing , Main Character Approach of Do-er and Story Driver of Action ) . <p> Munny and Sarah feel like different characters than Po and Erin . The former group comes across reluctant and introverted ; the latter eager and extroverted . Dramatica identifies the precise reason for this : all four stories require action for resolution , only one group feels comfortable doing so . <p> Defeating Tai Lung ? Same as defeating PG&amp;E . ( Story Outcome of Success ) Inspiring the master Shifu to prevent the monster his Dragon Warrior crusade created ? Same as inspiring Ed Masry to stand up and prevent PG&amp;E from delaying the case any further ( Influence Character Resolve of Change and ( Influence Character Solution of Prevent/Avoid ) . When you have a story where the Main Character refuses to back down from their drive to help and they end up changing the world around them for the better you 'll have a character like Shifu or Ed to personalize that modification . <p> Stories function through the same process of problem-solving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner in which resolution , if any , is achieved determine the Act structure of each individual story .

The drive to understand all that is Dramatica sometimes works against Authors . In a case where too much knowledge can be a bad thing , suppressing the urge to overthink may prove beneficial . <p> Dramatica 's Crucial Element . In a theory as complex and comprehensive as Dramatica , the idea that one part may be more crucial than another tends to be an attention-grabber . Further examination proves the concept to be less important as the name implies . The Crucial Element is crucial to the storyform , not the story itself . It details the connecting tissue between the Main Character and Overall Story Throughlines , not the lynchpin for your story 's success.1 In other words the element is more crucial to the Author in understanding his or her story , rather than an element crucial for the Audience to pick up on . If you ignore it , other story points will make sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying it ? Chris Huntley , co-creator of the theory has this to say about the crucial element : <p> When all is said and done , the crucial elements are only ONE of MANY pieces of the storyform . Leaving them out of your story wo n't ruin the experience for your audience , but adding them does tend to make the story stronger . <h> The Problem with Crucial Elements <p> If you followed the above link , or have researched the Crucial Element previously , you came across this : <p> If the MC is change and the outcome is success , the MC crucial element is the same as the MC problem . <p> If the MC is change and the outcome is failure , the MC crucial element is the same as the MC solution . <p> The first makes sense . The Main Character was part of the problem everyone was facing ( like Luke in Star Wars or Neo in The Matrix ) ; they change and everything works out . <p> The second does n't . How can the Main Character have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Character Problem defines who he is , how can he possibly be defined in the Overall Story Throughline as the opposite element ? It makes sense that if our Main Character is dealing with Actuality and sees things for how they are , then logically he should have that same element in the Overall Story . Yet here is Dramatica saying otherwise . Wo n't this make our Main Character schizophrenic ? <p> The answer requires a little perspective . <h> Objective and Subjective Views <p> If a story represents an analogy to the problem solving process of the mind then it follows that a story should showcase views from within and without.2Inequities ( conflict ) look different depending on your point-of-view . The efforts to resolve conflict will appear differently as well , depending on the kind of story you want to tell . <p> So while your Main Character may personally be suffering from too heavy a reliance on what actually happened ( Actuality ) , objectively they might be driven to alter how things seem to be ( Perception ) . Especially if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following is an excerpt from an email I sent to a reader exploring this somewhat duplicitous stance Dramatica takes . The storyform in question identified these key story points:3 <p> MC Resolve : Change <p> OS Goal : Understanding <p> Story Outcome : Failure <p> MC Problem : Actuality <p> MC Crucial Element : Perception <h> Putting the Crucial Element to Work <p> " ... when it says your MC has a Crucial Element of Perception that is referring to his or her function in the Overall Story . I 'm not sure exactly what your Overall StoryThroughline is about but if , for example , all your characters were concerned with figuring out why 1/3 of the world 's population simply disappeared ( totally ripping this off from HBO 's " The Leftovers " ) , then you might look at it this way . <p> Let 's say your Main Character leads a new religion based on the perception that the reason they are left here is because of something wrong they have done in the past , i.e. the 1/3 disappeared because of the " Rapture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they themselves did wrong . <p> OK . That is the Overall Story Throughline . <p> Now let 's say the Main Character Throughline is all about the man 's dead wife . He ca n't get over the fact that he was responsible for her death ( Kind of ripping this off from Inception ) . He was the one driving the car the night she was killed , he was the one who had too much to drink that night , he was the one who thought he could make it past the intersection in time ... you get the point--regardless of whether or not it was an accident the facts of the matter are--he killed her . And he ca n't get over it . <p> You see how this plays nicely into the Overall Story ... here 's a guy who is torn up over what he did , and now projects that guilt onto everyone else around him , perceiving that this worldwide event is punishment for wrongs they all have done . <p> Perception when it comes to everyone else and those leftover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inequity at the heart of the story remains the same , it remains a singular instance of separateness . It simply looks like Actuality from within and Perception from without . <p> He does this by taking the Perception he was putting out for everyone in the Overall Story and placing it instead within his own Personal Throughline . <p> So instead of going to those religious zealot meetings and continuing the perception that they all are guilty , the Main Character turns it back on himself--maybe through therapy or whatever--and finds that the only way to get rid of his guilt is through changing his own perceptions of what happened that night . Essentially fooling himself into seeing that--yeah , maybe he was right to try and make it past that intersection . Just because he was drunk does n't mean to him it was n't the right decision at that time . The facts do n't lie , but he was the one actually driving the car ... from his point-of-view he made the right decision ... and that 's all that matters . <p> But see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Overall Story and using it for his own personal problems , the Main Character removes the opportunity for that Perception to have a positive impact on everyone . It is true that all these people disappeared , and it is a lot of pain for those left behind to go through--almost the same kind of pain the MC felt living a life without his beloved . A little perception--no matter how misguided--could have helped alleviate the suffering and depression of millions ... but that 's not the story you 're trying to write . <p> Your story ends in Failure . Which means everyone in the big picture story--everyone " leftover " from this cataclysmic event--will be left unable to understand why any of this happened . The efforts to Understand ( Overall Story Goal ) will end in Failure . Instead of coming to place where they Understand that sometimes s*** happens , they 'll be forced to simply imagine what happened to their loved ones and work towards figuring out a plan to live out their lives alone ( Overall Story Consequence : Conceptualizing ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crucial Element plays out nicely in a story like this . What a character deals with personally may be different than what he or she puts out there in the real world . His or her personal " stuff " will still be connected--just not the way you think it will because you 're looking at things from a single perspective.4 <p> Beyond simply connecting the Overall Story Throughline with the Main Character Throughline , the Crucial Element ensures a continuity of thematic intent--the whole Change/Failure/Good Actuality to Perception storyform you have decided to tell comes through loud and clear for everyone in the Audience to understand . In addition , the storyform has made the Main Character a complex character , conflicted on different levels . Always a good thing . <p> The question now is ... is that the story you wanted to tell ? <p> For a story to feel complete it needs to have 4 different Throughlines , each representing a different perspective on the story 's central inequity .

In order to do this , you need to understand the connections that some appreciations have with one another . <p> Some authors like to write what they want to write without a single thought spent on their audience . Others write by focusing on their audience from the very beginning . Either way is acceptable ; the end result will be the same . <p> There are four major Audience AppreciationsNature , Essence , Reach and Tendency . From what I understand these appreciations describe how your audience will receive your story . I say as far as I understand because personally , I do n't  use them that much . This could be because they 're at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its because there 's enough elsewhere to worry about ! <p> These appreciations can not be selected directly in the software ; their answers instead come as a result of other choices you make . If you 'd like to know how you can think of your audience first , here are the combinations : <h> Nature <p> The Dramatica defintion describes Nature as : <p> The seminal dramatic framework of a storys message which indicates if the Main Character makes a proper decision to Change or Remain Steadfast . <p> Which is to say were the Main Characters assumptions of what was going on correct when they arrived at the climax of a story ? <p> Was it really a dilemma that the Main Character was facing ( Actual Dilemma ) or did it just seem that way ( Apparent Dilemma ) ? Did the Main Character really need to dig her heels in ( Actual Work ) , or was she wrong about what was really going on around her ( Apparent Work ) ? Because of the choices made in reference to the Resolve and Outcome , your audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essence <p> This one I never usemainly because instinctively it seems wonky to me . The quick definition of Essence is : <p> Makes sense , but what about Star Wars ? If the above is true , then Dramatica sees Star Wars as having a Negative Feel . Huh ? Luke has a major chip on his shoulder ( Stop ) that in the end , he is able to resolve ( Good ) . Seems pretty positive to me . Is this part of Dramatica wrong ? <p> I do n't  think so . Instead of negative or positive I like to think of Heavy or Light . A film with a Negative Feel will feel very Heavyalmost as if there is a huge weight pressing down on the Main Character . I think this comes as a result of our focus on their Growth . As the Dictionary Definition of Essence says , " In a Negative Story , the focus is on the effort to escape the problem . " " To an audience that burden to escape feels heavy . <p> Likewise in a Positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very Light . In a Positive Story , the focus is on the effort to find the solution , the Dictionary adds , no longer does our focus as an audience feel like an extra added burden . Finding a solution suggests a feeling of freedom and perhaps hope . <p> So its not so much that we feel down or depressed in a Negative Essence story ( I certainly did n't  feel that way with Star Wars ) , its just that an audience will instinctively feel this way towards their overall appreciation of your story.1 <h> Reach <p> Who will empathize with your story and who will simply sympathize with it ? Turns out the answer could be Male or Female , both or neither , all depending on the Mental Sex of the particular audience member . <p> For Male ( mental sex ) audience members , their empathy/sympathy factor is determined by Mental sex . Male audience members will tend to empathize with Male Mental Sex main characters , and tend to sympathize with Female Mental Sex main characters . For Female ( mental sex ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story Limit . Female audience members will tend to empathize with Optionlock stories , and tend to sympathize with Timelock stories . <p> So if you want only Male audiences members to really empathize with your Main Character ( Armageddon ) set the Mental Sex to Male and Story Limit to Timelock . Want to write a chick flick ( Pride and Prejudice ) ? Then set the Mental Sex to Female and the Story Limit to Optionlock . Want both sexes to empathize ? Set it to Male and Optionlock like they did in The Devil Wears Prada . While often referred to as a chick flick , Prada appealed to a much wider audience than *Pride and *Prejudice . Audience Reach had a great deal to do with that . <p> Of course , if you want to write a story no one will empathize with set it to Female and Timelock . Good luck with that ! <p> Tendency is also probably the easiest to understand .

Its nice to know the Reach of my story ( which for some reason or another always ends up Both ) and whether my Main Character will be Willing or Unwilling to involve themselves in the Objective Story . But I do n't  pay much attention to the other two . Your results may vary . <p> Still , its interesting to see that an audience will feel certain things based on the combination of certain structural items . <p> Please note that this article appears in our Vault section and therefore serves a historical purpose , not an educational one .

To help in the discussion , he offers an example : <p> One day Marias entire family is gunned down by evil drug lords . She tries to grieve , to get help , to assist the police . When she realizes that the police have no intention of genuinely pursuing the crime , she realizes she has to become ( i.e. " be-er " ) a detective herself . When she finds evidence pointing to a corrupt police chief as the actual culprit and that the cops wont help her , she decides she has to become a vigilante . <p> On the surface this seems to function properly . Main Characters have a preference towards solving their personal problems : either externally as Do-ers , or internally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Main Character Approach . Note the emphasis on personal problemsthis is the heart of the confusion most encounter when writing this kind of character into an action story . <p> The writers example above focuses more on the Overall Story Throughline , rather than the Main Characters personal Throughline . Dramatica makes a distinction between both : the Overall Story Throughline looks at the problems everyone in the story is dealing with ; in this case , evil drug lords gunning down families . The Main Character Throughline focuses on intimate personal issues that only the Main Character experiences . Often these issues develop within the characters backstory and are likely the kind of thing that would accompany the Main Character into any story . <h> The Action Hero <p> This preference for external or internal action will flavor the Main Characters interaction with the Overall Story . A character who prefers to solve problems internally might find themselves a bit ill-prepared for a story that requires external action to be taken . Likewise a character bent on taking external action to resolve personal issues will struggle with stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissonance between the two Throughlines comes about as a result of the combination of the Main Characters Approach ( Do-er or Be-er ) and the Story Driver ( Action or Decision ) . Dramatica labels this story point Tendency as it determines " the degree to which the Main Characer feels compelled to accept the quest . " <p> One can write an " action hero " into any story , regardless of Tendency . The " action hero " label describes the characters function in the Overall Story Throughlineusually as the Protagonist.1 While the " Be-er " Approach might impact this function in the Overall Story , by definition it does n't  . The Approach is all about the characters personal baggage . <p> Chris Huntley , co-creator of the Dramatica theory of story , explains : <p> Within the SPECIFIC CONTEXT of the storys inequity as seen from the MCs perspective , however , there exists a PREFERENCE to try to resolve inequities FIRST by applying effort internally ( be-er ) or externally ( do-er ) . If that approach does not resolve the inequity , the MC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequity using the alternative approach . This MC APPROACH is independent of the overall story functions assigned to the player that is also the MC . <p> Taking action as a vigilante ? That is the action of a Protagonist . Becoming a vigilante ? That depends on the Main Characters personal issues and whether or not they have a long-standing personal issue of struggling with changing their essential nature . Often this is not the case and is representative of the tendency of writers to blend the Throughlines together before determining their differences . <h> An Inclusive Approach to Story Points <p> As the one of the minds responsible for the theory , Huntley offers this unique perspective : <p> I think part of the problem here comes from thinking of one thing to the exclusion of others . That never works well in Dramatica . <p> We all exist within the internal and external worlds . A be-er is not devoid or unaware of the external world . A do-er is not devoid or unaware of the internal world . <p> I prefer assertive and passive over active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of energy applied . An assertive BE-ER uses a high level of energy . A passive BE-ER uses a low level of energy . An assertive DO-ER uses a high level of energy and a passive DO-ER uses a low level of energy . This " energy level " appears to impact the MCs effort , though not necessarily the effectiveness ( which is context specific ) . <p> To most writers of action-driven fare , the Be-er Main Character appears to be passive . These writers assume that if action is required then a character who would rather change themselves can only be shown as a passive entity . As Chris explains , focusing on the assertiveness , or lack of assertiveness , of the Main Character is a more effective approach . Both Do-ers and Be-ers are active characterstheir only difference lies in where they apply that energy .

If Abby had instead adopted Jack 's more " positive " viewpoint then perhaps the wishing would have led to a greater sense of community spirit and a fading desire to believe in superstitions . They would have elevated themselves by holding sway over their own lesser natures . <p> Unfortunately he did n't , and the lesser of two evils persists . However , this failure is bittersweet as it turns out to be a Good thing for everyone " particularly Abby . Breaking out of one 's socio-economic standing is difficult , if not impossible . Standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only thing you can do to feel whole . <h> Connecting Truth to Heart <p> By identifying truisms near and dear to my own belief systems , my motivation for writing and completing this story skyrockets . Instead of simply defining the argument to be made to the Audience , I now know what I want to argue to the Audience . Yes , being grateful can lead to a greater sense of community but really , if you want to feel good against an impossible situation you sometimes have to take what you can when you can . <p> By connecting what I deeply hold true to a solid and well-crafted argument , my story becomes uniquely mine . My beliefs , my experience , my desire to express myself to the greater community drives my heart to connect with yours . <p> And for that , I will be forever grateful . <p> Apparently the week of Thanksgiving is the time to prepare to defend one 's point-of-view by thinking intensely about truth and context . Bring on the family discussions over religion and politics ! ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some writers find the motivation to write in some personal experience , some struggle they overcame that they want to share with an Audience . Others find inspiration in the works of others . Wanting to relay the same kind of message , but with different characters and a different setting requires an understanding of the thematics deep within the narrative . <p> In our last two articles , we took a look at Dramatica and its ability to help writers interested in engaging in Nanowrimo find and develop a story they will want to finish . In Creating a Story From Scratch for Nanowrimo we found a compelling story centering around the occult in the Old West . In Brainstorming a Brand New Genre for Nanowrimo we manifested an insane narrative combining elements of the Teen Sex Genre with the Sword &amp; Sorcery Genre . <p> Some writers , however , find the desire to participate in Nanowrimo by reading a great novel or seeing a moving film . Inspired by the message of the narrative , would-be Authors seek to replicate that same kind of feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storyform for a film or novel they love , an Author can adjust certain elements of storytelling to create a new narrative unique to their own experience . <h> Balance and Temperment with the Use of Gists <p> Key to modifying the storyform lies in the use of Dramatica 's Gist feature . Added to the latest version of Dramatica " Dramatica Story Expert " the Gists bridge the space between story structure and storytelling.1 Instead of Cause and Effect , writers would find Inciting an Argument and Having Negative Repurcussions . Instead of Non-accurate and Accurate , writers would find Being Vauge and Tolerating Harsh Work Conditions . <p> While powerful and productive during the course of a brainstorming session , overuse tends to limit and stifle the writer 's personal voice . Gists require a balance and temperment that comes with an understanding of how they affect Dramatica 's model of story . <h> A Model of the Storymind <p> A common request we receive in regards to our Gists Collections centers around completing the Gists down to the Element level . As of today , November 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Domains and the Concerns . The Issues and Problems go untouched . <p> The Dramatica theory of story sees a fully functional narrative as an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem " or Storymind . The theory models this single human mind with a Table of Story Elements : <p> The four levels of each tower examine the story 's central inequity " the one created by what most consider the Inciting Incident " at different levels of magnification . Domains , the Class level at the top , take the widest look at a kind of inequity while Problems , the Element level at the bottom , take the narrowest or more accurately defined look at the essence of the inequity . <p> Why leave the bottom two levels untouched ? The closer you are to the bottom of the model , the closer you are to accurately identifying the exact source of trouble in a story . The more clearly defined that exact source of trouble becomes , the more constrictive and prescriptive the Gist . What once was a platform for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer to an application 's random number generator . <h> Narrowing One 's Opportunity for Expression <p> For instance , suppose you spun Dramatica 's story engine with our Narrative First War Genre Gists installed . As of today , November 2016 , you might receive a Main Character Throughline like this : <p> DOMAIN : Being Avaricious Towards the Ensign <p> CONCERN : Pretending to Be a Lieutennant <p> ISSUE : Being Mentally Gifted vs . Desire <p> PROBLEM : Causing a War <p> SOLUTION : Exploring the Aftereffects of Something <p> SYMPTOM : Being Passable as Something <p> RESPONSE : Being Outside Someone 's Tolerances <p> UNIQUE ABILITY : Losing a Particular Group 's Ability to Be Something <p> CRITICAL FLAW : Being Useful for Something <p> BENCHMARK : Growing Apart From the Romans <p> SIGNPOST 1 : Hatching Ideas About Hanoi <p> SIGNPOST 2 : Posing as the Air Forces <p> SIGNPOST 3 : Figuring Out How the Inflatable Boat Works <p> SIGNPOST 4 : Converging With the Captain <p> As you can see , the Gists from our Collection show up within the Domain , Concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dramatica define the type of conflict that occurs within each Act of a Throughline . In the example above , Act One would find this Main Character Hatching Ideas about Hanoi , Act Two would find this Main Character moving from Posing as a Member of the Air Force to Figuring Out How the Inflatable Boat Works , and finally Act Three would show this character Converging With the Captain . <p> On a side note , how crazy is it that those four movements feel like a complete dramatic movement ? That 's the strength behind Dramatica 's storymind concept . <p> The Signposts look to the Type , or Concern , level because at this magnification the inequity appears to be more closely related to Plot . <p> As one increases or decreases magnification , the inequity shifts from looking more like Character to more like Genre . In fact , each level carries with it an aspect of the Storymind more commonly known as either Character , Plot , Theme , or Genre . At the highest mangification the inequity plays through Character , while the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to narrowest , the difference in magnification appears as : <p> Genre at the Domain level <p> Plot at the Concern level <p> Theme at the Issue Level <p> Character at the Problem Level <p> With Dramatica 's Gists suggesting concrete examples of storytelling for Genre and Plot , the writer maintains relative freedom underneath to explore the personal aspects of narrative like Theme and Character . If we were to reverse that trend and make suggestions for the bottom half , the writer would feel rooted and constricted by the demands of the foundation " leaving little room to sway and bend towards the top . <h> An Example of Writing-By-Numbers <p> Suppose that our War Collection tracked all the way down to the character level . Instead of the above , our story might look something like this : <p> In our first example , the Domain and Concern of Being Avaricious Towards the Ensign and Pretending to Be a Lieutennant still gave us room to play around with the Problem of Causing a War and the Solution of Exploring the Aftereffects of Something . One Main Character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pretend to Be a Lieutennant to compensate , but be driven to self-destruction by Causing Class Warfare only to find relief in Exploring the Aftereffects of an After-School Program for Underprivileged Kids . But another could be Greedy Towards a Rich Ensign which leads him to Pretend to Be a Lieutennant to compensate , but be driven to self-destruction because of his need to instigate violent conflict with those around him only to find relief in Exploring the Aftereffects of Combat on Innocent Villagers and the Battlegrounds that used to be their Neighborhoods . <p> Same Domain and Concern , same basic personality and overall plot , but completely different instances of character at the root of it all . The first main character is driven by class warfare , the second by a deep-rooted violent nature . Dramatica leaves the writer free to expand upon the most intimate parts of a Throughline when the bottom of the structure is open to interpretation . <p> Contrast that with the last example of Dramatica-by-Numbers where we have a Domain and Concern of Believing One Is Inferior to a Team Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What A Sniper Should Do and Embracing Immediate Benefits from the Front Lines despite Winding Up in Leavenworth . <p> Harder to find examples of different characters who both find their deepest baggage stemming from doing what snipers should do and personal relief in embracing immediate benefits despite winding up in Federal prison . There is some wiggle room , but the range narrows compared to the non-Gistified versions of Problem and Solution . <p> CRITICAL FLAW : Putting One 's Life in Danger Regardless of the Danger it Puts Others In <p> BENCHMARK : Reconciling a Troubled Family History <p> SIGNPOST 1 : Watching Family and Friends Go Off to War <p> SIGNPOST 2 : Making Amends with Your Father <p> SIGNPOST 3 : Looking Forward to Returning Home <p> SIGNPOST 4 : Being There for Your Fellow Soldier <p> The story of how Desmond Doss ( played by Andrew Garfield ) stood up for what he believed in despite all odds inspires the very best in those who take the time to experience it . But not everyone loves a war drama . Suppose you , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aspiration in your Audience " an Audience turned off by war " and dream of setting this story somewhere other than 1945 Okinawa . <p> Reducing the Domain and Concern down to Being a Pacifist and Not Wanting to Live with Regret and the Problem and Solution down to Helping Someone and Being a Nuisance makes this possible . You could tell the story of a draft-dodger during the Vietnam era , a space freighter during the great Galactic Wars , or the son of a teamster during the 1950s . Each can be seen as being driven by wanting to Help Someone . <p> Keeping the Problem and Solution of Helping Wounded Soldiers Stay Alive and Being a Nuisance to the Army would destroy that possibility . What once opened up the possibility of inspiring different Audiences attracted to 1950s labor unions or 1960s anti-war efforts or even science-fiction fans now reduces this potentially moving story to those attracted solely to war dramas . <h> Conclusion <p> Once you find a storyform that speaks to you , you can express it in many different ways . While Dramatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements at play within that storyform , an overabundance of these storytelling helpers locks the writer in to telling the same exact story . By reducing the Story Points further down the model to their essential natures , writers can take that initial spark of inspiration and corral it help guide and structure their own versions of the same story . <p> While there exists several incarnations of a single storyform , the meaning for that story " that message that inspires and motivates one to relay it to others " stands alone . One storyform , one meaning . Gists help open up the avenues of creativity for the writer , yet lock the artist down when abused . <p> When finding inspiration in the works of others to help define your own message , first identify the storyform that sits at the heart of it all while keeping the general sense of the conflict encoded within the specific storytelling at the top of the model . Leaving room at the bottom grants creative space for the writer to expand and express their own personal take on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Author balances meaning with expression , creating a narrative unique and special and unlike any other . <h> Brainstorming a Brand New Genre for Nanowrimo <p> Why limit yourself to the tried and true ? Westerns , Sci-Fi , Action/Adventure , Romantic Comedies--all successful and effective genres for reaching a broad Audience . For the true artist looking to expand their creativity , these categories of narrative only begin to speak of the enormous potential for story . <p> In our last article , Creating a Story from Scratch for Nanowrimo , we set about constructing a Western unlike any other Western before . Using our Narrative First Western Genre Gist Collection " exclusive to Narrative First Members " we spun Dramatica 's model and identified story elements that told of major occult influences . In less than a couple of hours , we molded the framework for a powerful and meaningful narrative that could sustain us throughout the month of November . <p> This week , we want to amplify our potential for creativity by infusing one genre within another . In the spirit of one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peanut butter to our chocolate . High-concept narratives depend on this approach : <p> High level of uniqueness : Whereas originality is about approach and fresh perspective , uniqueness is about being one-of-a-kind , first time , and incomparable . Being original can also involve uniqueness , but being unique transcends even originality . Sometimes this is achieved in the content or in the execution of a work . <p> In the spirit of finding peanut butter to chocolate and of Nanowrimo , we continue our exploration of Brainstorming with Dramatica by diving into creating a brand new genre : the Teen Sex Fantasy Genre . <h> Dramatica Story Points and Gists <p> For those unfamiliar with " gists " and their use within the Dramatica theory of story , consider how difficult it can be to come up with a Main Character when presented with these story points : <p> Domain : Fixed Attitude <p> Concern : Impulsive Responses <p> Problem : Process <p> We answer a bunch of questions in Dramatica and this is what the app tells us our Main Character is all about ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a problem of process ? What does that even mean ? <p> Now let 's look at the same Main Character , only this time we will turn on Dramatica 's powerful Gist feature : <p> Domain : Fearing Crowds <p> Concern : Being Rash about Something <p> Problem : Hating an Overly Complicated Process <p> Suddenly , this character makes more sense . Thirteen year old Robb fears crowds , is concerned with being rash about something ( let 's make it food selection for this week 's grocery shopping ) , and hates an overly complicated process . The last one still seems a bit odd , but we can imagine a character who needs to learn how to go through the motions but is so impatient and hasty that he often makes the wrong decision . <p> For someone who is very picky and selective about what they eat , being impatient and impulsive presents a significant source of conflict to overcome . Thanks to the Gists , we now understand Process as a Problem . <p> Dramatica 's Gists bridge the gap between storyform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock Dramatica because of its " obtuse " terminology . Prerequisites , Non-accurate , Process , Preconditions , Dividends , and Costs--these sound more like what you would find on a Yearly TPS Report , not what you find at the heart of every complete narrative . <p> The Gists help writers transition between structure and story . <p> The storyform contains the narrative code of the story . Robb still sits in a Domain of Fixed Attitude , a Concern of Impulsive Responses , and a Problem of Process . But with Dramatica 's Gist feature , we now have a better idea of what those three story points are all about . <h> Of Wizards and Sex <p> Several years ago , Danny McBride and his team of amazing comics created a movie that combined raunchy sex comedy with the sword-and-sorcerers genre popular in the mid-80s . Entitled Your Highness , the film bombed--an unfortunate result of its tired and broken narrative . <p> Key to the film 's failure was its lack of a proper Influence Character and corresponding Relationship Story Throughline . Natalie Portman 's character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Character Prince Thadeous " does n't arrive until a full hour into the film . And when she does , her worldview and unique perspective fails to properly match up against Thadeous ' issues . This lack of cohesion within the narrative dynamics forces a lack of interest in the final outcome . <p> What if instead , the filmmakers had access to our Narrative First Teen Sex and Fantasy Genre Gist Collections , installed them into Dramatica , and randomly spun the model ? They might have discovered a story that not only satisfies their intended Audience but also delivers a meaningful and cohesive narrative . <h> Preparing the Story Engine <p> First , we would set the Story Engine to reflect a typical arrangement of Story Dynamics for this kind of film : <p> A Steadfast Main Character Resolve ensures that the stoner " bro " at the center of it all does n't have to do too much emotional growth ; immature minds typically prefer to be the ones to sit back and watch everyone else develop . The Linear Problem-Solving Style , Do-er Approach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the narrative . Setting the Driver to Action , the Outcome &amp; Judgment to Success/Good and the Overall Story Throughline to an Activity strengthens the story 's marketability by keeping it well within a studio executive 's expectations . <p> The only thing left to do would be to venture over to Dramatica 's Brainstorming feature and spin the model <h> Combining Stoner Culture with Dungeons &amp; Dragons <p> Looking over the first storyform Dramatica offered us , the story seems scattered and all over the place <p> until we start fleshing out the individual story points . <h> Main Character Throughline <p> DOMAIN : Being Stranded in the Liquor Store <p> CONCERN : Being Current About the Scene Kids <p> ISSUE : Being Repelled by Something vs . Attraction <p> PROBLEM : Being Likely <p> Thadeous , no longer a prince , is stuck running his father 's tavern for the weekend . Obsessed with staying current with the cool kids in the village to the point of being creepy ( he 's 43 ) , he kicks anyone out who even remotely drags down the reputation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the kind of person who would rather be safe than sorry " even if it means kicking out older patrons he knows could hook him up with drugs or a date with an older woman " just so that he can look cool in front of the other kids . <h> Influence Character Throughline <p> DOMAIN : Having Biases for a Princess <p> CONCERN : Thinking Seriously About a Daddy 's Princess <p> ISSUE : Reconsidering Past Decisions vs . Appraisal <p> PROBLEM : Using Deductive Reasoning on a Particular Group <p> Isabel operates from a similar place of needing validation from others with her obsession for the King 's daughters.1 While everyone mocks and disregards the airheaded ramblings of the King 's spoiled princesses , Isabel gives them the respect they deserve " even to the point of getting into a physical altercation with Thadeous when he refuses to let them into his tavern . If they 're hot , and they 're rich , and they 're single and available for marriage , they 're worth everyone 's attention and worth fighting for . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> SIGNPOST 1 : Having a Phobia About the Sorority Girl <p> SIGNPOST 2 : Thinking Seriously About the Diaphragm <p> SIGNPOST 3 : Forgetting the Babysitters 's First Day <p> SIGNPOST 4 : Having Knee Jerk Reactions to the Perverts <p> We know she starts out the story deathly afraid of sorority girls , even though they 're more conscientious and thoughtful when compared to the King 's daughters . Her defense of them leads her to completely ignore the diaphragm found in their chambers ( indicating that the King 's daughters do not share Isabel 's sexual preference ) , and finds her embarassed when the daughters completely forget their planned playdate with Isabel the day she was to babysit their nephew . <p> Crushed , and influenced heavily by Thadeous and his better safe than sorry angle , Isabel changes her worldview by conjecturing that the princesses are perverts and do n't want their daddy to know how sexually active they are . She would have seen it earlier if she had n't been so caught up in all the glitz and glamour of the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they truly are . <p> And gets high to forget about them ( with Thadeous of course ) . <h> Relationship Story Throughline <p> Isabel gets to that character defining moment because of her relationship with Thadeous " the classic mentor/mentee relationship . Luke and Yoda . Neo and Morpheus . Isabel and Thadeous . <p> DOMAIN : Being Troublesome in the Police Station <p> CONCERN : Being Inspired by the Triple A <p> PROBLEM : Being Idle <p> SOLUTION : Protecting <p> Thadeous teaches and manipulates Isabel to become a troublesome nuisance to the local magistrate . How else to make sure that he remains distracted enough to overlook the seedy but ever-so-popular activities at Thadeous ' place ? Inspired by the coolest Triple A halfling ever to walk these lands , both Thadeous and Isabel find common ground over their idle and lackadaisacal ways . Neither is willing to lift a finger for the other ; their hipster laziness pulling them together and driving their relationship forward . In the end , they 'll come together when they start looking out for each other and covering each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally we have the central plot line of the entire film , a story about : <p> GOAL : Finding Out About the Condom <p> CONSEQUENCE : Getting the Idea That the Daddy 's Princesses Is Hated <p> As Protagonist , Thadeous will be driven to find out who the condom he found in his tavern belongs to . Was it a cool kid ? A degenerate halfling thief ? Or maybe even Isabel herself ? The truth is it belonged to the King 's daughter " or at least her boyfriend , who refused to get her pregnant because he did n't want to have children with her . <p> The king 's daughter wants to marry her boyfriend and if her father were ever to find out what her boyfriend did , it would be lights out for him . Isabel , smitten by the princess , promises to make sure no one ever finds out " and this puts her in direct conflict with the very loud and obnoxious Thadeous . <p> REQUIREMENT : Understanding the Geeks 's Limitations <p> PREREQUISITE : Outdoing a Peeping Tom by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to understand the limitations the princesses ' boyfriend put on their relationship , while outdoing a peeping giant by skillfully planning ways to work during his sleep schedule . <p> FOREWARNINGS : The Count 's Horse Having a Past <p> And , of course , the disturbing and well-known sordid past of the Count 's horse only makes it more certain that the King will eventually find out what happened with his daughter . After all , her boyfriend is the Count 's son , and if he was willing to wear a condom with his father 's horse , there 's no telling what he would do with the king 's beautiful princess <h> A Story for All Time <p> OK . So the story went a bit off the rails there at the end ! Yet , regardless of how troubling that Forewarning story point turned out be , the story as a whole held together . <p> This is the same experience found in the yearly Dramatica Users Group meetings held in December . Instead of analyzing a film , we spend the night brainstorming story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , what starts out seemingly disjointed and disconnected , ends up coming together in a way that almost feels like magic . <p> Now , you may not feel like a sex and sorcery film about finding the owner of a condom would find a large enough Audience , but if you were to continue to flesh out this storyform the end result would be a complete and meaningful narrative . Thadeous finds the owner of that condom because Isabel finally gave up her obsession for the princesses long enough to hypothesize that they did n't want their daddy to know they were straight . That solution cuts quick to the chase and right through to Isabel 's character flaw and works exceedingly well with the main plot line because all these story points balance each other out . Her conjecturing led to finding out who owned the condom . And that conjecturing came about because of Thadeous ' success with playing it safe than sorry ( just like the Count 's son ) <p> By combining the genre of Teen Sex with Fantasy , we came up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a stoner stuck in his dad 's Tavern for the weekend , intent on learning the identity of a condom 's owner . The mentorship he strikes up with the local tomboy teaches them both the importance of looking out for each other when dealing with people in positions of power and authority . And finally , we show that a healthy dose of paranoid speculation ( amplified by certain drug use ) can keep us all from looking like fools . <p> Insane , but insanely effective in terms of story structure and meaningful narrative . Now all it needs a heaping serving of comedic storytelling on top to make it an enjoyable and memorable experience . <p> Teen Sex &amp; Fantasy only begin to scratch the surface . With the Narrative First Genre Gist Collections , Authors can combine all sort of different and disparate Genres to challenge and inspire themselves to write something wholly brand new . Nanowrimo is about writing that story that did n't exist in October . Now write that story in a genre no one expects . <p> Guess Isabel is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? <p> November 3 , 2016 <h> Creating a Story from Scratch for Nanowrimo <p> Writing an entire novel in a single month challenges Authors everywhere to simply get it done . While well-meaning and encouraging , efforts to participate in Nanowrimo finds some writers floundering without any sense of purpose or direction . Quickly setting up a framework for your literary endeavor keeps the flame of inspiration alive and works as a helpful guide those thirty days . <p> This week kicks off National Novel Writing Month or Nanowrimo for short . A " fun , seat-of-your-pants approach to creative writing " , Nanowrimo challenges Authors to write a 50,000 word novel by 11:59PM on November 30th . While many can manage the 1,700 words a day Nano requires , writing something of substance and with purpose eludes most . <p> The real challenge lies in writing something meaningful . Sure , enthusiasm and dedication count , but without direction and intent that initial excitement often wanes " leaving many Authors well short of the 50K goal . A Dramatica storyform aids writers in making sure their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , but are n't quite sure how to say it " Dramatica aligns your thinking , making it coherent and impactful . <p> And it may be you have no idea what it is you want to say , but you know you need to write something this November . Dramatica can help there too . <h> Spinning a Story <p> Assume you at least know what genre you want to write in1 , and that genre is a Western . Maybe you 're inspired by the HBO series Westworld , or you just saw the latest incarnation of The Magnificient Seven . Either way you know you want to write a Western , you 're just not sure where to start . <p> After installing the Gist Collection into your copy of Dramatica , you load up the Brainstorming Tool , set the options to Replace Existing Storyform and Assign Random Gists , and then click Spin . <p> And in an instant , Dramatica delivers the structure of a meaningful story : <p> Now , this is quite a story . Looks like we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baronness . Could be some religious overtones there , or some kind of cult at workwhich instantly brings to mind some combination of the occult and a Western . Has that been done before ? ! <p> Even if it has , the version in my head " the version Dramatica sparked in my head " will be completely different than anyone else 's version . <p> Five minutes ago I had no idea what I was going to write this November . Suddenly I know I 'm writing a story about the occult in the Old West . Many see Dramatica as simply a tool for analysis " here you can clearly see it 's power as a sounding board for creativity . <p> And that 's only one story point ! <h> Making It All Fit Together <p> Looking further into the storyform , we see that everyone is concerned with their devotion to the U.S. Marshal and issues of looking forward to seeing a particular group . Substitute the words " Jesus " or " The Black Witch " for " a particular group " and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town 's inhabitants . <p> And an Overall Story Solution of Holding Sway Over Someone ? That 's a dark way to bring resolution to a story about a cult . Suddenly , I really love this story ! <p> Looking over at our Main Character , we find a character consumed with arresting a bounty hunter and trapping bandits . Perhaps the local sheriff 's deputy " a young woman " because every other man who took the job ended up dead and left town . Her need to prove herself and show that she can do these things only gets her into more trouble " especially when you see that she ca n't stand wishy-washy people ( a Main Character Problem of Re-examining Conclusions ) . <p> And just look at that Main Character Unique Ability of Being Moral . What a pain in the ass to all those cultists ! The Main Character Unique Ability is the kind of thing that will help Abby2 bring resolution to the Overall Story about the cultists and their righteousness towards the baronness . <p> And Abby would do just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local unpleasant and repulsive gold miner who cuts quick to the chase , makes his kill , and gets out . His acerbic nature and unihibited nature drives Abby crazy and challenges her to reconsider tracking down that bounty hunter . <p> Now this is a brainstorming exercise . Which means you , as the Author , do n't have to follow what Dramatica gives you as a gist precisely . These are suggestions meant to inspire situations and character . <p> I was n't connecting with the specific instance of " Being Odious Towards the Forty Niner " because I did n't want Jack to be all about someone else . So I simply took the Being Odious part , mixed it up with someone who is attacking and quick to kill like a pistol , and added in the uninhibited nature . Put them all together and you have the makings of an interesting and compelling character . <p> What 's more " you have a character that is perfectly designed to interact and challenge Abby on a deep on a personal level . Why ? <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn them off and you will see why Jack works so well against Abby . Underneath those clever Gists we provided you sits the Dramatica storyform and its elements of story . <p> Here you can see the foundation for Jack 's Throughline : <p> Being Odious is simply another way of defining Manipulation <p> Personifying a Pistol is Changing One 's Nature <p> Being Unihibited is Uncontrolled . <p> Manipulation , Changing One 's Nature , and Uncontrolled are exactly the kind of story elements needed to challenge Abby and her Activities , her Concern of Obtaining , and her drive of Reconsider . <p> Arresting the Bounty Hunter is an Activity <p> Trapping the Bandits is Obtaining <p> Re-examining Conclusions is Reconsider <p> Dramatica 's Gists walk the border between storyform and storytelling . I guarantee I would never have discovered the character of Jack Lawler by simply reading Manipulation , Changing One 's Nature , and Uncontrolled . But with the Gists feature turned on , my imagination and " muse " kicks in " allowing me the freedom to create while simultaneously enjoying the safety net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , I 'm not wasting my time . <p> And Nanowrimo is all about time . <h> Notions of the Weeks Ahead <p> From here I could start writing . In fact , if I did n't have a story consulting business to run , an animated feature to write , and mentor students to mentor I would be writing this cult Western all month long . That 's how excited I am about it . <p> And the storyform tells of so much more <p> Jack will eventually change his acerbic nature by virtue of being inspired by Abby 's character . This will play out with him Being in Command of Something ( probably the Mayor , or he joins the Army ) . <p> The townspeople Fail to Wish Gold into Existence ( such an amazing awesome Goal for a story about a cult ! ) and instead focus on Having the Horse 's Future Told <p> What an amazing awesome Goal for a story about a cult ! You can just see cultists on their knees wishing for Gold , led to living the righteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some dire future predicted of the town 's one horseamazing ! <p> Time runs out , but they all end up in a better place emotionally <p> With the Timelock , we know everyone will be concerned with some deadline . Perhaps their wishes can only hold up until the frost comes . When that happens they 'll be left with only Percy ( the horse ) to look to for guidance <p> which , while crazy , is shown to be a " good " thing . While the townspeople may still be caught under the fog of cultist ideals , perhaps their blindness is just what they need in order to survive . The Story Judgment of Good works with the Story Outcome of Failure to indicate a story of Personal Triumph . While they failed in their quest to wish Gold into existence , relying on something tangiblesomething they already had ( the horse ) could be the one thing that gives them hope . And maybe that 's all Abby needed to learn as well <p> Crazy , yes . But crazy good . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can create an instant classic in less than an hour ? ! The Magnificent Seven may be a great storybut it does n't have Abby , it does n't have the righteous Cattle Baronness or the cultists who turn to a horse for guidance , and it certainly does n't have Jack Lawler , acerbic gold miner turned General . In the time it took to write this article ( 1700 words exactly by the way ) , I now have the foundation for a compelling and exciting story to write this month . <p> Dramatica offers writers and participants of Nanowrimo an opportunity to expand their writing horizons while ensuring that what they write contains purpose and meaning . Some enjoy writing by the seat-of-the-pants , but end up discouraged and frustrated when their seat fails to carry them through the pointless jumble that spills from their minds . A Dramatica storyform puts the pieces together in such a way that they all add up to a greater purpose : telling a story that means something .

They rebel at the very thought that there could somehow be some order to their chosen form of expression . <p> Yet , works bred of ego and blind ambition often flounder when crossing the finish line that is Audience Reception . They show up--yet ultimately have nothing meaningful to say , in part because they did n't follow the " rule " . <h> The First Rule of Narrative Science <p> By " rule " , of course , we refer to a standard set when looking at story as an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem . Rather than yet another in a hundred and some odd ways to beat the Hollywood reader , this reality occurs because of the processes that go on within the act of working out a problem . Dramatica ( the first iteration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , if you see story as having no boundaries and no limitations then by all means , write to your heart 's content . Fly , be free . <p> Just do n't expect the rest of us to remain engaged in your work . <p> Audiences expect stories to think like they do . Run counter to their instinctual responses and they 'll turn away in droves . <p> One of the very first of these rules to be encountered within Dramatica states that when it comes to the two central characters of a story--the Main Character and Influence Character--one will change , and the other will remain steadfast . <p> If they both change the story breaks . <h> How Can a Character Not Change ? <p> Eventually this standard finds the need to defend itself when it comes to certain great films . Consider Toy Story . When asked which principal character changes , Woody or Buzz , many answer both . Woody finds it within himself to allow another toy the top spot and Buzz discovers he 's not really the Space Ranger he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously Malcom Crowe ( the Bruce Willis character ) changes , but does n't little Cole change as well when he finally musters up the courage to visit the poisoned girl ? And what of Pride and Prejudice-- does n't that classic beloved novel tell the story of two characters meeting in the middle ? <p> Perhaps Narrative Science misses the mark . Perhaps there are exceptions to this rule ... <p> not quite . <p> The problem lies in Dramatica 's definition of change and what most people mean when they think of characters changing . <h> How Narrative Science Sees Character <p> Contrary to centuries of thought on story , Dramatica sees the two central characters of a story not as fully imagined three-dimensional people , but rather as a context for perspective . Remember the basic given about stories as analogies to problem-solving ? To fully comprehend and gain meaning from this act of problem-solving , all perspectives need to be addressed . One man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom-fighter ? That 's the kind of dissonance differing perspectives offer ; that 's how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Character gives the Audience an intimate perspective of the story 's central problem . From here we experience what it is like to actually deal with the problem personally , as if " I " have the problem . The Influence Character offers up an alternative to the Main Character 's stance by showing how someone else deals with the problem . From there we experience what it is like for " You " to deal with the problem . <p> The Overall Story Throughline and the Relationship Story Throughline round out those perspectives by offering us a chance to see how " They " experience the problem and how " We " experience the problem , respectively . But for now , seeing the Main Character and Influence Character as perspectives rather than fully-realized people makes it easier to explain the reason for that first rule . <h> Giving Meaning through Problem-Solving <p> The Influence Character enters the picture and tension mounts . Conflict now occurs because two competing perspectives have come into play ; two different approaches towards solving the story 's central problem . Both believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order for this model of story as problem-solving process to work out , one must eventually give way to the other . Capitulation leads to resolution which in turn , leads to meaning . By showing whether or not the " winning " perspective leads to triumph or tragedy , the Author proves the appropriateness of using a certain perspective to solve problems . <p> The Author crafts greater meaning to a story 's events . <p> Sometimes the Influence Character was right , the Main Character changes perspective and the story results in triumph ( Star Wars , The King 's Speech and Finding Nemo ) . Sometimes it was the Main Character who was right , the Influence Character justly surrenders and the story results in triumph ( Star Trek , In the Heat of the Night , and The Iron Giant ) . Sadly though there are times when being " right " was actually wrong . The Main Character " wins " with the Influence Character changing perspective , yet the result tumbles into tragedy ( Brokeback Mountain , Moulin Rouge ! and Reservoir Dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If both principal characters change their perspectives , the outcome of the story loses all purpose . Who 's approach was the best ? How am I to solve my own problems in life ? What exactly was this story trying to say ? <p> Surely compromise solves problems . But in order to tell that story , one character would have to maintain an all-or-nothing perspective while the other would call for greater synergy . The former would eventually change and the story would end in triumph , proving that compromise solves problems . <p> When a story simply shows two characters coming together , both changing , that alternative perspective ceases to exist and a hole the size of Texas ( or perhaps Antarctica ) opens up within the story 's argument . The Author fails to show the problem from all sides . Suddenly the Author leaves space for exceptions , giving opportunity for an Audience to dissent and eventually discount their work wholesale.1 <p> In other words , no one will go see the movie . <h> A Call for Greater Clarity <p> Rules of story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dramatica--exist to give purpose to the telling of a story . Break them and the story itself becomes dysfunctional . Rare is the Audience member who voluntarily hangs out with a schizophrenic mind . <p> Still , one ca n't argue with the success and greatness of Toy Story , The Sixth Sense and Pride and Prejudice . Do these stories fail in making their arguments ? Clearly the principal characters in each changes their perspectives . How does one explain their effectiveness as complex stories within the context of this rule of change and steadfast ? <p> Look no further than Disney 's Tangled and Brave for real-world examples of what happens when both principal characters change . These disasters of story structure suffer from a lack of narrative purpose . ? ?

This is the same " layered " method I mentioned in blog posts and newsletters earlier this Summer . As Melanie explains : <p> Often structure is brought into the picture too soon , clamping your passion into an iron maiden that pierces it more deeply with every turn of a structural screw until it bleeds out entirely . In contrast , writing with purposeless abandon creates a jellyfish of a story : an amorphous blob of subject matter with no spine , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . <p> I have witnessed great advances with my own clients who prefer a more organic approach to writing by using a method similar to this one . By waiting until the last second to start applying structure , the " pantser " can feel free to let their imagination run wild . <p> Melanie offers a free service that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it up another notch " you can actually enlist her to help you personally with the development of your story .

@@119273871 @8273871/ <p> The reason why want vs. need fails for creative writers is because it is an interpretation of meaning after the fact .

Problem and Solution ( Pair #1 ) describe the source of the Main Characters personal conflict and the element that will resolve that problem . Symptom and Response ( Pair #2 ) describe the symptomor side effectof the problem and the treatment applied to resolve it . <h> The Same Four Elements <p> The four elements work together to define the character and the conflict they work through . Far from reductive , the arrangement of other thematic elements within the story work to increase or produce a greater variety of character . Both Finn in Star Wars : The Force Awakens and Max in Mad Max : Fury Road share the same four elements , yet see a difference between the real problem and the apparent problem . <p> Finn has a Problem of Support ( wont kill for anyone ) , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) . That Support Problem creates a side-effect of Pursuit ( the First Order will chase him from one end of the galaxy to another ) and a Response of Avoid ( he runs from everythinggood and bad ) . Max switches things around . Max has a Problem of Avoidance ( always running from thingsgood or bad ) and a Solution of Pursuit ( when he actually turns around and heads back to fight ) . That Avoidance Problem creates a side-effect of Oppose ( its him against the world ) and a Response of Support ( an attraction to those who show him loyalty , i.e. Furiosa ) . <p> Similar sounding personal Throughlines to be surebut different enough to warrant closer examination . Finn pursuing a fight was n't enough to resolve his personal problems , he actually had to show that he could stand up against someone .

The character arc describes the process of character Growth that tears down the blinders act by act until the character is able to see Pair #1 as an alternative ( and original ) source and solution to the MC inequity . <p> For Steadfast characters , the character believes Pair #2 is the cause of its personal problems and MAY be aware that the MC Problem in Pair #1 is the source of its drive/motivation , but does not attempt to resolve the MC Problem .

Originally I wrote : <p> Katereassesses her position on activities near the border changing the present day situation in favor of the U.S. ( Story Goal of The Present and *Story Outcome : Success ) . <p> This would mean that the Overall Story Solution of Re-evaluation would also be put in place . Unfortuantely , I do n't  think that happened . And while it is true that Graver and his crew were able to complete their mission , I think the intent of the Author was to show that nothing had really changed . <p> The key proof of this lies in that final scene where the son of the corrupt policeman plays soccer . As the childs widowed mother and neighbors watch , gunfire erupts in the streets of Ju+rez . The look on the parents faces almost tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final sequence of events acts as a bookend to our initial introduction to Ju+rez and the warnings left for those who might consider working with authorities . <h> Goals &amp; Consequences <p> Every complete story has an Overall Story Goal and an Overall Story Consequence . You cant have a Goal without a Consequence , otherwise there would be no motivation towards that Goal . If the story ends in Success then the Goal is attained ; if the story ends in Failure then the Consequence comes into play . <p> Stories with a Goal of the Present have a Consequence of Contemplations " and this is precisely what we see with Sicario . Those people left hanging from the steel girders during the extradition sequence ? That is a message from the cartels telling the people of Ju+rez to think before they act . Those " fireworks " at the end that briefly interrupt the childrens soccer game ? A continuation of that uneasy state-of-mind and a call for the citizens of that border town to think before they contemplate snitching ( Overall Story Consequence of Contemplations ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does nothing to change the order of Signposts in the Overall Story . Here you can see the order in a Success story : <p> And here you can see the order in a Failure story : <p> The order of Signposts in the other Throughlines , however , do shift . The Influence Character Signpost One switches from Changing Ones Nature to Developing a Plan . Alejandro was definitely not dealing with Becoming or Changing Ones Nature during the first act . If anything he was there acting as an advisor on how best to plan a strategy to fight the cartels . <p> The Relationship Signpost Four also switches from Contemplations to Innermost Desires . While it is true there is a signficant amount of consideration forced upon Kate at the end , that is more personal in nature and less about the actual relationship . I think it is more accurate to see their Relationship devolving into a place of fear and terror ( a negative desire ) . <p> Another significant change lies in the Relationship Story Problem and Solution , Symptom and Response . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Response with the Overall Story ; in a Failure story it shares the Problem and Solution . This means that the Problem that drives the relationship between Kate and Alejandro shifts from Probability to Evaluation . Again , I think it is safer to say that the problems in their relationship begin with their initial assesments of each other ; first impressions are everything . And when I think about it even further , just like the Overall Story , the Relationship Throughline fails to reach a successful resolution . The Reevaluation that would bring them together simply does n't  come into play . <h> Accuracy of the Message <p> As with all things Dramatica , accuracy in the storyform is more important than getting it right the first time . I once spent seven years on a story that I thought was a Success , but my intuition kept forcing into a Failure . It was n't until I aligned the storyform with my muse that I was finally able to finish the story properly .

Looking beyond the success explored through character and plot in these stories is the success these films experienced when released to the general public . Two of them won Oscars for their masterful writing , while the third made over half a billion dollars at the box office . While the Main Characters of these films may have gone home sad , the filmmakers certainly did not . <p> Audiences appreciate and embrace these kinds of stories because they shed light on why things are the way they are . People crave these stories because they crave meaningful conclusions to their endeavors .

Originally I wrote : <p> Katereassesses her position on activities near the border changing the present day situation in favor of the U.S. ( Story Goal of The Present and *Story Outcome : Success ) . <p> This would mean that the Overall Story Solution of Re-evaluation would also be put in place . Unfortuantely , I do n't  think that happened . And while it is true that Graver and his crew were able to complete their mission , I think the intent of the Author was to show that nothing had really changed . <p> The key proof of this lies in that final scene where the son of the corrupt policeman plays soccer . As the childs widowed mother and neighbors watch , gunfire erupts in the streets of Ju+rez . The look on the parents faces almost tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final sequence of events acts as a bookend to our initial introduction to Ju+rez and the warnings left for those who might consider working with authorities . <h> Goals &amp; Consequences <p> Every complete story has an Overall Story Goal and an Overall Story Consequence . You cant have a Goal without a Consequence , otherwise there would be no motivation towards that Goal . If the story ends in Success then the Goal is attained ; if the story ends in Failure then the Consequence comes into play . <p> Stories with a Goal of the Present have a Consequence of Contemplations " and this is precisely what we see with Sicario . Those people left hanging from the steel girders during the extradition sequence ? That is a message from the cartels telling the people of Ju+rez to think before they act . Those " fireworks " at the end that briefly interrupt the childrens soccer game ? A continuation of that uneasy state-of-mind and a call for the citizens of that border town to think before they contemplate snitching ( Overall Story Consequence of Contemplations ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does nothing to change the order of Signposts in the Overall Story . Here you can see the order in a Success story : <p> And here you can see the order in a Failure story : <p> The order of Signposts in the other Throughlines , however , do shift . The Influence Character Signpost One switches from Changing Ones Nature to Developing a Plan . Alejandro was definitely not dealing with Becoming or Changing Ones Nature during the first act . If anything he was there acting as an advisor on how best to plan a strategy to fight the cartels . <p> The Relationship Signpost Four also switches from Contemplations to Innermost Desires . While it is true there is a signficant amount of consideration forced upon Kate at the end , that is more personal in nature and less about the actual relationship . I think it is more accurate to see their Relationship devolving into a place of fear and terror ( a negative desire ) . <p> Another significant change lies in the Relationship Story Problem and Solution , Symptom and Response . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Response with the Overall Story ; in a Failure story it shares the Problem and Solution . This means that the Problem that drives the relationship between Kate and Alejandro shifts from Probability to Evaluation . Again , I think it is safer to say that the problems in their relationship begin with their initial assesments of each other ; first impressions are everything . And when I think about it even further , just like the Overall Story , the Relationship Throughline fails to reach a successful resolution . The Reevaluation that would bring them together simply does n't  come into play . <h> Accuracy of the Message <p> As with all things Dramatica , accuracy in the storyform is more important than getting it right the first time . I once spent seven years on a story that I thought was a Success , but my intuition kept forcing into a Failure . It was n't until I aligned the storyform with my muse that I was finally able to finish the story properly .

If you do n't , you really have n't set anything up as much as you may have tied one Throughline to another . <p> The Inciting Incident of a story is usually felt as the moment when the Overall Story and Main Character Throughlines kick in--yet , the Overall Story Throughline can happen several minutes or pages before that moment . <h> Think Story Driver Instead of Inciting Incident <p> The Dramatica theory of story does n't even bother with the Inciting Incident for two reasons : <p> One , it 's completely subjective when it actually occurs <p> Two , it really does nothing to the actual narrative drive of a story <p> Instead , Dramatica singles out a Story Driver as the instigator and motivator of a narrative .

@@119273910 @8273910/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> The First Dramatica Scene Analysis <p> A complete perfectly structured scene consists of four Events . When using the Dramatica theory of story to analyze or create a scene , four modalities of Scene Construction exist : <p> TKAD ( Fixed Attitude , Situation , Activity , Mentality ) <p> PRCO ( Potential , Resistance , Current , Outcome ) <p> SRCA ( Setup , Revelation , Conflict , Aftermath ) <p> PASS ( Passive , Active , Structural , Storytelling ) <p> The first three modalities are applied to the four major Events of a complete Scene . Each Event gets one TKAD , one PRCO , and one SRCA . When the totality of the first three are exposed the scene feels complete both emotionally and logistically . <p> The last modality sets the mode by which the Author intends to illustrate the scene . In contrast to the first three , the Author does not apply a member of PASS to each of the four Events , but rather selects one to color the illustration of the first three modalities . <h> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene from A Separation , wife Simin wants to leave the country of Iran with her husband Nader and her daughter Termeh . Simin does not want her daughter to grow up within the current conditions of the country . The husband refuses to even consider " his father is i 'll and must be cared for at all times . Naders determination to stay in Iran forces Simin to file for divorce . <p> This first scene is her application for that divorce . <p> Studying the scene we see four major Events : <p> Simin desires a better life for her daughter . <p> Nader refuses to consider . <p> Husband and wife argue with the judge as they plead their side <p> The judge refuses to decide in Simins favor . <p> First we will go through the first three modalities : <h> TKAD <p> Here we identify the source of conflict in each Event : <p> Situation : Simin and her daughter are women stuck in modern-day Iran . <p> Fixed Attitude : Naders confidence that his way is the only way is the focus of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their point of viewinterrupting one another . <p> Mentality : The judge passively aggressively scolds the parents for bringing their argument to court . <p> Applying TKAD colors the Event by enriching it with meaning and purpose . Instead of the judge simply refusing , he refuses through Mentalityand gentle manipulation . <h> PRCO <p> Secondly , we identify the source of Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome of the dramatic unit in this scene . <p> Potential : Nader is absolutely dead set with his convictions . He has no doubt that his way is the way . <p> Resistance : The judge , overwhelmed with cases like this , prefers to take the easy way out . <p> Current : Husband and wife argue over what will most likely happen if the other wins . <p> Outcome : Simin sees great opportunity for her daughter elsewhere . <p> Again , the modalities enrich the Events by giving them greater dramatic impact . The judge leaving things open is n't the end , its the juice that runs through this scenethe possibility of things working out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . As the events unfold in a linear fashion ( without any fancy StoryWeaving time-shifting techniques ) identifying the order is as simple as jotting down the order in which the events were presented to us in the film . <p> Setup : Simin makes her appeal . <p> Revelation : Nader explains why its a bad idea . <p> Conflict : Husband and wife plead their side <p> Aftermath : The judge refuses to decide in Simins favor . <p> Pretty cut and dried . Note that SRCA does not match with the PRCO . This happens as a byproduct of dynamic choices made by the Author . <h> PASS <p> Lastly , we color these three modalities with our means of illustrating the scene . This is a Passive Structural scene . While it passes on information concerning the storyform , it does not further the story along the way an Active Structural scene would . <p> This means we color the above with Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre . Note that Dramatica sees Genre differently " almost as a Perspective " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perspectives of narrative : Entertainment , Comedy , Drama , and Information . <p> The Author passes along important , yet passive , structural information through these Events : <p> Character through Naders obstinate attitude . <p> Plot through the judges decision not to side with Simin . <p> Theme : through husband and wife arguing back and forth . This is a thematic statement repeated throughout the film : Individuals more interested in arguing their side , rather than coming to a synergistic conclusion . <p> Genre : through Simins situation we learn what it is like for women in Iran today and perhaps find out something we did n't  know previously . We see her Situation in terms of Information . <p> The judge refuses to side with Simin ( Aftermath , Mentality , Resistance , Plot ) <p> With every modality accounted for , this scene in A Separation stands out as one of the greats . Storywise , it feels emotionally complete and logistically satisfying . In a fractal sense it works like a mini-story , a small dramatic unit that works as a part of a greater whole .

Others find inspiration in the works of others . Wanting to relay the same kind of message , but with different characters and a different setting requires an understanding of the thematics deep within the narrative . <p> In our last two articles , we took a look at Dramatica and its ability to help writers interested in engaging in Nanowrimo find and develop a story they will want to finish . In Creating a Story From Scratch for Nanowrimo we found a compelling story centering around the occult in the Old West . In Brainstorming a Brand New Genre for Nanowrimo we manifested an insane narrative combining elements of the Teen Sex Genre with the Sword &amp; Sorcery Genre . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nanowrimo by reading a great novel or seeing a moving film . Inspired by the message of the narrative , would-be Authors seek to replicate that same kind of feeling . Dramatica functions best in this scenario . By taking the storyform for a film or novel they love , an Author can adjust certain elements of storytelling to create a new narrative unique to their own experience . <h> Balance and Temperment with the Use of Gists <p> Key to modifying the storyform lies in the use of Dramaticas Gist feature . Added to the latest version of Dramatica " Dramatica Story Expert " the Gists bridge the space between story structure and storytelling.1 Instead of Cause and Effect , writers would find Inciting an Argument and Having Negative Repurcussions . Instead of Non-accurate and Accurate , writers would find Being Vauge and Tolerating Harsh Work Conditions . <p> While powerful and productive during the course of a brainstorming session , overuse tends to limit and stifle the writers personal voice . Gists require a balance and temperment that comes with an understanding of how they affect Dramaticas model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A common request we receive in regards to our Gists Collections centers around completing the Gists down to the Element level . As of today , November 2016 , our collections focus on the top two levels : the Domains and the Concerns . The Issues and Problems go untouched . <p> The Dramatica theory of story sees a fully functional narrative as an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem " or Storymind . The theory models this single human mind with a Table of Story Elements : <p> The four levels of each tower examine the storys central inequity " the one created by what most consider the Inciting Incident " at different levels of magnification . Domains , the Class level at the top , take the widest look at a kind of inequity while Problems , the Element level at the bottom , take the narrowest or more accurately defined look at the essence of the inequity . <p> Why leave the bottom two levels untouched ? The closer you are to the bottom of the model , the closer you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . The more clearly defined that exact source of trouble becomes , the more constrictive and prescriptive the Gist . What once was a platform for unbridled creativity now becomes a set of manacles tying the writer to an applications random number generator . <h> Narrowing Ones Opportunity for Expression <p> For instance , suppose you spun Dramaticas story engine with our Narrative First War Genre Gists installed . As of today , November 2016 , you might receive a Main Character Throughline like this : <p> DOMAIN : Being Avaricious Towards the Ensign <p> CONCERN : Pretending to Be a Lieutennant <p> ISSUE : Being Mentally Gifted vs . Desire <p> PROBLEM : Causing a War <p> SOLUTION : Exploring the Aftereffects of Something <p> SYMPTOM : Being Passable as Something <p> RESPONSE : Being Outside Someones Tolerances <p> UNIQUE ABILITY : Losing a Particular Groups Ability to Be Something <p> CRITICAL FLAW : Being Useful for Something <p> BENCHMARK : Growing Apart From the Romans <p> SIGNPOST 1 : Hatching Ideas About Hanoi <p> SIGNPOST 2 : Posing as the Air Forces <p> SIGNPOST 3 : Figuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Converging With the Captain <p> As you can see , the Gists from our Collection show up within the Domain , Concern , and Signposts . Why Signposts ? The Signposts within Dramatica define the type of conflict that occurs within each Act of a Throughline . In the example above , Act One would find this Main Character Hatching Ideas about Hanoi , Act Two would find this Main Character moving from Posing as a Member of the Air Force to Figuring Out How the Inflatable Boat Works , and finally Act Three would show this character Converging With the Captain . <p> On a side note , how crazy is it that those four movements feel like a complete dramatic movement ? That 's the strength behind Dramaticas storymind concept . <p> The Signposts look to the Type , or Concern , level because at this magnification the inequity appears to be more closely related to Plot . <p> As one increases or decreases magnification , the inequity shifts from looking more like Character to more like Genre . In fact , each level carries with it an aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plot , Theme , or Genre . At the highest mangification the inequity plays through Character , while the lowest reveals itself through Genre . Top down , from broadest to narrowest , the difference in magnification appears as : <p> Genre at the Domain level <p> Plot at the Concern level <p> Theme at the Issue Level <p> Character at the Problem Level <p> With Dramaticas Gists suggesting concrete examples of storytelling for Genre and Plot , the writer maintains relative freedom underneath to explore the personal aspects of narrative like Theme and Character . If we were to reverse that trend and make suggestions for the bottom half , the writer would feel rooted and constricted by the demands of the foundation " leaving little room to sway and bend towards the top . <h> An Example of Writing-By-Numbers <p> Suppose that our War Collection tracked all the way down to the character level . Instead of the above , our story might look something like this : <p> In our first example , the Domain and Concern of Being Avaricious Towards the Ensign and Pretending to Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Problem of Causing a War and the Solution of Exploring the Aftereffects of Something . One Main Character could be Greedy Towards a Rich Ensgin which leads him to Pretend to Be a Lieutennant to compensate , but be driven to self-destruction by Causing Class Warfare only to find relief in Exploring the Aftereffects of an After-School Program for Underprivileged Kids . But another could be Greedy Towards a Rich Ensign which leads him to Pretend to Be a Lieutennant to compensate , but be driven to self-destruction because of his need to instigate violent conflict with those around him only to find relief in Exploring the Aftereffects of Combat on Innocent Villagers and the Battlegrounds that used to be their Neighborhoods . <p> Same Domain and Concern , same basic personality and overall plot , but completely different instances of character at the root of it all . The first main character is driven by class warfare , the second by a deep-rooted violent nature . Dramatica leaves the writer free to expand upon the most intimate parts of a Throughline when the bottom of the structure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of Dramatica-by-Numbers where we have a Domain and Concern of Believing One Is Inferior to a Team Leader and Adoring the Green Berets and a Problem of Doing What A Sniper Should Do and Embracing Immediate Benefits from the Front Lines despite Winding Up in Leavenworth . <p> Harder to find examples of different characters who both find their deepest baggage stemming from doing what snipers should do and personal relief in embracing immediate benefits despite winding up in Federal prison . There is some wiggle room , but the range narrows compared to the non-Gistified versions of Problem and Solution . <p> CRITICAL FLAW : Putting Ones Life in Danger Regardless of the Danger it Puts Others In <p> BENCHMARK : Reconciling a Troubled Family History <p> SIGNPOST 1 : Watching Family and Friends Go Off to War <p> SIGNPOST 2 : Making Amends with Your Father <p> SIGNPOST 3 : Looking Forward to Returning Home <p> SIGNPOST 4 : Being There for Your Fellow Soldier <p> The story of how Desmond Doss ( played by Andrew Garfield ) stood up for what he believed in despite all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to experience it . But not everyone loves a war drama . Suppose you , as an Author , want to instill the same kind of inspiration and aspiration in your Audience " an Audience turned off by war " and dream of setting this story somewhere other than 1945 Okinawa . <p> Reducing the Domain and Concern down to Being a Pacifist and Not Wanting to Live with Regret and the Problem and Solution down to Helping Someone and Being a Nuisance makes this possible . You could tell the story of a draft-dodger during the Vietnam era , a space freighter during the great Galactic Wars , or the son of a teamster during the 1950s . Each can be seen as being driven by wanting to Help Someone . <p> Keeping the Problem and Solution of Helping Wounded Soldiers Stay Alive and Being a Nuisance to the Army would destroy that possibility .

Others find inspiration in the works of others . Wanting to relay the same kind of message , but with different characters and a different setting requires an understanding of the thematics deep within the narrative . <p> In our last two articles , we took a look at Dramatica and its ability to help writers interested in engaging in Nanowrimo find and develop a story they will want to finish . In Creating a Story From Scratch for Nanowrimo we found a compelling story centering around the occult in the Old West . In Brainstorming a Brand New Genre for Nanowrimo we manifested an insane narrative combining elements of the Teen Sex Genre with the Sword &amp; Sorcery Genre . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nanowrimo by reading a great novel or seeing a moving film . Inspired by the message of the narrative , would-be Authors seek to replicate that same kind of feeling . Dramatica functions best in this scenario . By taking the storyform for a film or novel they love , an Author can adjust certain elements of storytelling to create a new narrative unique to their own experience . <h> Balance and Temperment with the Use of Gists <p> Key to modifying the storyform lies in the use of Dramaticas Gist feature . Added to the latest version of Dramatica " Dramatica Story Expert " the Gists bridge the space between story structure and storytelling.1 Instead of Cause and Effect , writers would find Inciting an Argument and Having Negative Repurcussions . Instead of Non-accurate and Accurate , writers would find Being Vauge and Tolerating Harsh Work Conditions . <p> While powerful and productive during the course of a brainstorming session , overuse tends to limit and stifle the writers personal voice . Gists require a balance and temperment that comes with an understanding of how they affect Dramaticas model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A common request we receive in regards to our Gists Collections centers around completing the Gists down to the Element level . As of today , November 2016 , our collections focus on the top two levels : the Domains and the Concerns . The Issues and Problems go untouched . <p> The Dramatica theory of story sees a fully functional narrative as an analogy to a single human mind trying to solve a problem " or Storymind . The theory models this single human mind with a Table of Story Elements : <p> The four levels of each tower examine the storys central inequity " the one created by what most consider the Inciting Incident " at different levels of magnification . Domains , the Class level at the top , take the widest look at a kind of inequity while Problems , the Element level at the bottom , take the narrowest or more accurately defined look at the essence of the inequity . <p> Why leave the bottom two levels untouched ? The closer you are to the bottom of the model , the closer you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . The more clearly defined that exact source of trouble becomes , the more constrictive and prescriptive the Gist . What once was a platform for unbridled creativity now becomes a set of manacles tying the writer to an applications random number generator . <h> Narrowing Ones Opportunity for Expression <p> For instance , suppose you spun Dramaticas story engine with our Narrative First War Genre Gists installed . As of today , November 2016 , you might receive a Main Character Throughline like this : <p> DOMAIN : Being Avaricious Towards the Ensign <p> CONCERN : Pretending to Be a Lieutennant <p> ISSUE : Being Mentally Gifted vs . Desire <p> PROBLEM : Causing a War <p> SOLUTION : Exploring the Aftereffects of Something <p> SYMPTOM : Being Passable as Something <p> RESPONSE : Being Outside Someones Tolerances <p> UNIQUE ABILITY : Losing a Particular Groups Ability to Be Something <p> CRITICAL FLAW : Being Useful for Something <p> BENCHMARK : Growing Apart From the Romans <p> SIGNPOST 1 : Hatching Ideas About Hanoi <p> SIGNPOST 2 : Posing as the Air Forces <p> SIGNPOST 3 : Figuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Converging With the Captain <p> As you can see , the Gists from our Collection show up within the Domain , Concern , and Signposts . Why Signposts ? The Signposts within Dramatica define the type of conflict that occurs within each Act of a Throughline . In the example above , Act One would find this Main Character Hatching Ideas about Hanoi , Act Two would find this Main Character moving from Posing as a Member of the Air Force to Figuring Out How the Inflatable Boat Works , and finally Act Three would show this character Converging With the Captain . <p> On a side note , how crazy is it that those four movements feel like a complete dramatic movement ? That 's the strength behind Dramaticas storymind concept . <p> The Signposts look to the Type , or Concern , level because at this magnification the inequity appears to be more closely related to Plot . <p> As one increases or decreases magnification , the inequity shifts from looking more like Character to more like Genre . In fact , each level carries with it an aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plot , Theme , or Genre . At the highest mangification the inequity plays through Character , while the lowest reveals itself through Genre . Top down , from broadest to narrowest , the difference in magnification appears as : <p> Genre at the Domain level <p> Plot at the Concern level <p> Theme at the Issue Level <p> Character at the Problem Level <p> With Dramaticas Gists suggesting concrete examples of storytelling for Genre and Plot , the writer maintains relative freedom underneath to explore the personal aspects of narrative like Theme and Character . If we were to reverse that trend and make suggestions for the bottom half , the writer would feel rooted and constricted by the demands of the foundation " leaving little room to sway and bend towards the top . <h> An Example of Writing-By-Numbers <p> Suppose that our War Collection tracked all the way down to the character level . Instead of the above , our story might look something like this : <p> In our first example , the Domain and Concern of Being Avaricious Towards the Ensign and Pretending to Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Problem of Causing a War and the Solution of Exploring the Aftereffects of Something . One Main Character could be Greedy Towards a Rich Ensgin which leads him to Pretend to Be a Lieutennant to compensate , but be driven to self-destruction by Causing Class Warfare only to find relief in Exploring the Aftereffects of an After-School Program for Underprivileged Kids . But another could be Greedy Towards a Rich Ensign which leads him to Pretend to Be a Lieutennant to compensate , but be driven to self-destruction because of his need to instigate violent conflict with those around him only to find relief in Exploring the Aftereffects of Combat on Innocent Villagers and the Battlegrounds that used to be their Neighborhoods . <p> Same Domain and Concern , same basic personality and overall plot , but completely different instances of character at the root of it all . The first main character is driven by class warfare , the second by a deep-rooted violent nature . Dramatica leaves the writer free to expand upon the most intimate parts of a Throughline when the bottom of the structure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of Dramatica-by-Numbers where we have a Domain and Concern of Believing One Is Inferior to a Team Leader and Adoring the Green Berets and a Problem of Doing What A Sniper Should Do and Embracing Immediate Benefits from the Front Lines despite Winding Up in Leavenworth . <p> Harder to find examples of different characters who both find their deepest baggage stemming from doing what snipers should do and personal relief in embracing immediate benefits despite winding up in Federal prison . There is some wiggle room , but the range narrows compared to the non-Gistified versions of Problem and Solution . <p> CRITICAL FLAW : Putting Ones Life in Danger Regardless of the Danger it Puts Others In <p> BENCHMARK : Reconciling a Troubled Family History <p> SIGNPOST 1 : Watching Family and Friends Go Off to War <p> SIGNPOST 2 : Making Amends with Your Father <p> SIGNPOST 3 : Looking Forward to Returning Home <p> SIGNPOST 4 : Being There for Your Fellow Soldier <p> The story of how Desmond Doss ( played by Andrew Garfield ) stood up for what he believed in despite all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to experience it .

You could tell the story of a draft-dodger during the Vietnam era , a space freighter during the great Galactic Wars , or the son of a teamster during the 1950s . Each can be seen as being driven by wanting to Help Someone . <p> Keeping the Problem and Solution of Helping Wounded Soldiers Stay Alive and Being a Nuisance to the Army would destroy that possibility .

Then you are going to have to learn how to write a complete story . In Dramatica this is easily done by making sure you cover all the Four Throughlines needed to make a complete argument .

@@119273944 @8273944/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Thoughts on Story Structure <p> I 've only tried one screenwriting plotting program . Dramatica attempts to formalize the process by which a crafty screenwriter creates a story . It boils down story structure to a " branching tree " of thirty-two thousand possible " storyforms " . By answering questions like " Does the Main Character succeed or fail ? " And " Is this a good thing or a bad thing ? " you settle on one storyform . It is supposed to take about a week to learn how to use Dramatica . I have no idea if Dramatica is worth the money , but the company has some happy reviews on their website . If you have trouble figuring out why your stories come out wrong , or just have trouble creating story structure , Dramatica or something similar might help . <p> Hahahahahahahaha . <p> A week and twenty years maybe . And even then you might end up completely borking your initial analysis of a great movie like Ex Machina . Dramatica is more than worth the money--if for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater understanding of story . <p> The Dramatica theory of story offers Authors a rare opportunity to look at their story from an objective point-of-view " from the perspective of what their story means , rather than how their story plays out . <p> Acts , Sequences , and Scenes exist in the Storytelling Domain . They help frame and illustrate meaning . Unfortunately , the infinite variety in which they can be appreciated and observed makes them deficient for an objective framework of story . <p> Keep Acts , Sequences , and Scenes for those paradigms and models of story that look at presentation and Audience Reception . But when it comes to Dramatica , the theory should likely pivot to ensure greater understanding of Dramatica 's unique story points and structure . <p> The Dramatica concept of the Throughline Issue used to be called Range with the first version of the theory back in 1994 . As Sequences travel through the Variation level of the model " where the Issues of a Throughline are found " why not use the original terminology to break free from ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrenched in that paradigm and their own preconceptions about what a sequence is to use both systems without cross-interference . <p> As far as Scenes go " as we develop an understanding of how Dramatica Scene Construction works , it becomes apparent that the idea of an actual " scene " varies depending on when you get into the Dramatic Unit ( quad ) and when you get out . Again , instead of relying on the physical concept of " the scene " to communicate the smallest meaningful part of Dramatica , why not start introducing Authors to this idea of a complete Dramatic Unit ? <p> They can still start their " scenes " late into the unit and can , of course , leave whenever they want . The important part is that Authors and producers and directors alike begin to understand the PRCO , SRCA , TKAD , and PASS of a Dramatic Unit . Combining that knowledge with whatever techniques they mastered on the other side of communicating a story will result in an effective and efficient storyteller . <p> It 's important to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about stories . Screenplays start on page one and go until they are finished , about 110 pages . Stories start when an inequity becomes problematic and ends when things are put back into balance . Stories are not confined to a physical form , they are a mental construct . <p> Which reminds me . Dramatica needs to pivot to different terminology when it comes to Scenes , Sequences , and Acts . <p> That 's a fancy way of saying that Snyder ( et al. ) are talking about how a story is laid out . <p> The key is to always think of Author 's Intent . When it comes to Dramatica " and looking at Scenes , Sequences , and Acts through that lens " the " message " or storyform the Author intends on communicating is the primary object of focus . <p> So think of the Potential of the circuit as the source of inequity for that dramatic movement as far as the Author is concerned . You 're not looking at where the Scene starts , but rather where the Author believes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose " it 's a matter of where the emphasis is placed . <p> In A Separation the Potential for conflict lies within Nader 's strict convictions . Remove his obstinate I 'm always right no matter what attitude and there is no real conflict . No back and forth arguing . No problem with Simin leaving . And the judge could go on living his happy life without interruption . <p> It is clear from this scenes , and from many others , that the Author of A Separation intended to show Nader 's attitude as one of the primary sources of conflict within the story . This scene is a microcosm of that intent . <p> The Resistance of a dramatic circuit amplifies or diminishes that Potential . In A Separation that amplification arrives in the form of the judge essentially siding with Nader . Overwhelmed by the system , he takes the easy way out figuring everything will work itself out . <p> Why is Simin 's hope for a better life for her daughter not the Resistance to the Potential found in Nader ? It certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit of meaning constructed by the Author it neither amplifies nor diminishes that inequity . <p> This is where paradgims of scene construction that look simply at the wants and needs of characters fall short for many Authors . Butting one character 's wants against the wants of another ( A man wants a delicious taco , another wo n't let him have it ) can lead to a zero charge for that scene . They effectively cancel each other out . <p> Dramatica , on the other hand , works with the Author to communicate his or her intention . In A Separation , the Author states that matters get worse for those involved because of this laissez-faire attitude in Iran that everything will work itself out . There 's nothing wrong with Simin 's attitude or their arguing " the Potential forumlated within Nader 's convictions is amplified by the system . That is part of the message of purpose intended by the Author . <p> The Current of a dramatic circuit shows the play , or interaction , between Potential and Resistance . In A Separation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the posturing and positioning between husband and wife as they try to make themselves heard . <p> In effect , the Author writes the conflict that arises from the Potential meeting up against the Resistance . It is possible the Author imagined this conflict first , then worked backwards to determine the Potential " the source of that inequity " and the Resistance that engendered the conflict in the first place . <p> And finally , the Power of the dramatic circuit displays the result or outcome of the other three " and the potential for conflict to arise in later scenes . In A Separation this Power lies in Simin 's hope for a greater future for her daughter . That notion of misplaced potential that lies in her young child trapped in a country that diminishes her importance . <p> Rather than seeing this desire as the Potential that drives the scene , the Author decides to encode it as the eventual Outcome of all the awfulness that came before . <p> To summarize : <p> The Potential of a dramatic unit is where the Author sees the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be no reason for the scene . <p> The Resistance of a dramatic unit amplifies or diminishes the Potential . In short , what does the Author believe makes things worse ? <p> The Current of a dramatic unit is the interaction between Potential and Resistance , the escalation or descalation of dramatic conflict as seen by the Author . <p> The Outcome of the dramatic unit is where the Author believes the Power of the circuit lies and where a possible potential for the next Scene arises . <p> There is a sense from this scene that not everything will work out the way it should . The alignment of these events within the dramatic unit and the order in which they are presented is the reason for that feeling . The PRCO and SRCA of every dramatic unit is purposeful and adds to the Author 's message carried within the code of the storyform . <p> A complete perfectly structured scene consists of four Events . When using the Dramatica theory of story to analyze or create a scene , four modalities of Scene Construction exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mentality ) <p> PRCO ( Potential , Resistance , Current , Outcome ) <p> SRCA ( Setup , Revelation , Conflict , Aftermath ) <p> PASS ( Passive , Active , Structural , Storytelling ) <p> The first three modalities are applied to the four major Events of a complete Scene . Each Event gets one TKAD , one PRCO , and one SRCA . When the totality of the first three are exposed the scene feels complete both emotionally and logistically . <p> The last modality sets the mode by which the Author intends to illustrate the scene . In contrast to the first three , the Author does not apply a member of PASS to each of the four Events , but rather selects one to color the illustration of the first three modalities . <h> An Analysis of One of the Greats <p> In the first scene from A Separation , wife Simin wants to leave the country of Iran with her husband Nader and her daughter Termeh . Simin does not want her daughter to grow up within the current conditions of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll and must be cared for at all times . Nader 's determination to stay in Iran forces Simin to file for divorce . <p> This first scene is her application for that divorce . <p> Studying the scene we see four major Events : <p> Simin desires a better life for her daughter . <p> Nader refuses to consider . <p> Husband and wife argue with the judge as they plead their side <p> The judge refuses to decide in Simin 's favor . <p> First we will go through the first three modalities : <h> TKAD <p> Here we identify the source of conflict in each Event : <p> Situation : Simin and her daughter are women stuck in modern-day Iran . <p> Fixed Attitude : Nader 's confidence that his way is the only way is the focus of his bad attitude . <p> Activity : Simin and Nader argue their point of view--interrupting one another . <p> Mentality : The judge passively aggressively scolds the parents for bringing their argument to court . <p> Applying TKAD colors the Event by enriching it with meaning and purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Mentality--and gentle manipulation . <h> PRCO <p> Secondly , we identify the source of Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome of the dramatic unit in this scene . <p> Potential : Nader is absolutely dead set with his convictions . He has no doubt that his way is the way . <p> Resistance : The judge , overwhelmed with cases like this , prefers to take the easy way out . <p> Current : Husband and wife argue over what will most likely happen if the other wins . <p> Outcome : Simin sees great opportunity for her daughter elsewhere . <p> Again , the modalities enrich the Events by giving them greater dramatic impact . The judge leaving things open is n't the end , it 's the juice that runs through this scene--the possibility of things working out in the future . <h> SRCA <p> Thirdly , we decide the order . As the events unfold in a linear fashion ( without any fancy StoryWeaving time-shifting techniques ) identifying the order is as simple as jotting down the order in which the events were presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes her appeal . <p> Revelation : Nader explains why it 's a bad idea . <p> Conflict : Husband and wife plead their side <p> Aftermath : The judge refuses to decide in Simin 's favor . <p> Pretty cut and dried . Note that SRCA does not match with the PRCO . This happens as a byproduct of dynamic choices made by the Author . <h> PASS <p> Lastly , we color these three modalities with our means of illustrating the scene . This is a Passive Structural scene . While it passes on information concerning the storyform , it does not further the story along the way an Active Structural scene would . <p> This means we color the above with Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre . Note that Dramatica sees Genre differently " almost as a Perspective " for the Event in consideration . The Dramatica Genre quad sees for Perspectives of narrative : Entertainment , Comedy , Drama , and Information . <p> The Author passes along important , yet passive , structural information through these Events : <p> Character through Nader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision not to side with Simin . <p> Theme : through husband and wife arguing back and forth . This is a thematic statement repeated throughout the film : Individuals more interested in arguing their side , rather than coming to a synergistic conclusion . <p> Genre : through Simin 's situation we learn what it is like for women in Iran today and perhaps find out something we did n't know previously . We see her Situation in terms of Information . <p> The judge refuses to side with Simin ( Aftermath , Mentality , Resistance , Plot ) <p> With every modality accounted for , this scene in A Separation stands out as one of the greats . Storywise , it feels emotionally complete and logistically satisfying . In a fractal sense it works like a mini-story , a small dramatic unit that works as a part of a greater whole . <p> Although it has " flow " a circuit is really seen as a unit , comprised of these four parts . <p> This is why we can start with the Outcome , like we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carries a Message and then move on to the Potential . PRCO describes the relationship between the parts of that dramatic unit . <h> Active , Passive , Structural , Storytelling <p> There is a section at the end of the article that I skipped over when I began this discussion on Scene Structure with Dramatica . I skipped it because the section felt like one of those things that fit into the category of Underdeveloped Dramatica Theory , like the Lost Theory Book " fun to think about , not at all practical . After a weekend spent contemplating the deep thematic considerations of individual scenes , I wonder this section 's impact on the modalities of scenes . <p> The quad of items discussed in that section consists of Active , Passive , Structural , and Storytelling . Collectively they indicate the particular mode of illustration for the Events in a Scene . They indicate the teaching of the storyform . <h> Structural or Storytelling <p> Interesting that an Event could declare itself either Character , Plot , Theme , or Genre . And the other three Events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conveys the storyform itself . <p> Storytelling Scenes illustrate these four Events in terms of audience impact ( impacting the audience 's sense of their own Situation , affecting their Attitude , involving them in a vicarious Activity , or exploring the way their minds run by illuminating the Mentality ) . <p> I suppose Storytelling Scenes are the " fun " ones . The ones that thrill or chill or make us laugh . They perhaps have little to do with the structure or storyform at all . Remove them and the meaning of the story would remain the same--it just would n't be as much fun . <p> This is compelling because , as I started to consider various scenes for examples , there were several examples that I felt were n't robust enough . Their modality as a strict Storytelling Scene is likely the answer . <h> Active or Passive <p> Last week I indicated these two were part of that last , or fourth , modality--then changed my mind . I might change it back again . <p> Both Structural and Storytelling Scenes can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Events in the Story or Audience . Active Scenes put them into motion , moving the story forward or invoking changes in the nature of the audience itself . <p> Now , for me , this is one of those Melanie pieces I need to write out again . Break the sentences down into something more visual . <p> Passive Storytelling Scenes illustrate the Events by impacting the Audience 's sense of Situation , Attitude , Activity , and way of Thinking <p> Active Structural Scenes use the four Events to move the story forward through Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre <p> Active Storytelling Scenes use the four Events to invoke changes in the nature of the Audience 's Situation , Attitude , Activity and Way of Thinking <h> Examples of Illustrating the Events <p> Many of the Death Star Attack scenes in Star Wars involve the Audience in a vicarious Activity . As did the Desert Chase sequence from Raiders of the Lost Arc . Passive or Active ? Active Storytelling . <p> The opening battle between husband and wife in A Separation ? Passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't push the story forward as they would with an Active Structural Scene . <p> The scene where Inigo Montoya stands up to the six-finger man in The Princess Bride ? Active Structural . Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre pushing the story forward . <p> The deli scene in When Harry Met Sally where Meg Ryan proves to Billy Crystal that women can fake anything ? Passive Storytelling meant to affect the Audience 's prejudiced Attitudes towards the other sex . <h> The Fourth Modality <p> After working through these items , this section is more important than I originally gave it credit . And I 'm pretty sure it replaces my idea of Proactive , Reactive , Defensive , and Inactive as the fourth modality . I was thinking Active and Passive when I developed those , but ignored Structural and Storytelling as I did n't find them pertinent . <p> Not anymore . <p> This quad illustrates TKAD and determines the force of Energy behind it . If the storyform " or TKAD " delivers the Understanding to the Audience , then PASS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storyform to an Audience . The Learning to the storyform 's Understanding . <p> What if we were to shift the sequence of PRCO at the Act level ? Instead of following the usual--and perhaps , predictable--pattern of 1234 ( or SRCA ) , what if we aligned the dramatic circuit to 4132 ? What would that do to the story ? More importantly , what would it feel like ? <p> Take our story from before , of the professor and the nephew and their struggle against the spy agencies of the world to bring a life-changing invention into existence . Thanks to the ingenuity of both , they succeeded and saved the world . <p> Let 's tell a different story . Same players , same potentials , same major plot events--but this time , let 's alter the order of the Plot Progression in the Overall Story : <p> Signpost 1 : Learning <p> Signpost 2 : Understanding <p> Signpost 3 : Obtaining <p> Signpost 4 : Doing <p> Already , it feels strange to think of our story in this order . The Learning used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning and now we conclude with Doing . What 's that going to be like ? <h> SRCA is NOT Storyweaving <p> Note that our markers for Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome remain the same : <p> Signpost 1 : Learning is still the Outcome <p> Signpost 2 : Understanding is still the Potential <p> Signpost 3 : Obtaining is still the Current <p> Signpost 4 : Doing is still the Resistance <p> As mentioned before , changing the order like this is not akin to time-shifting Storyweaving techniques found in films like Memento or Pulp Fiction . We can change the order in which the events from our first story are revealed to the Audience and the story will carry the same meaning . Changing the order of PRCO though--and thus , how the components relate to each other--will have a significant impact on the meaning of our story . <p> Let me show you . <h> The Beginning of a Different Story <p> An English professor screws over Chinese Nationalists by trading bogus inside information for access to secret technological hardware . The stealing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge for being duped and the Professor wants to use the secrets to invent a device to change the world . Tracking the Professor and Gathering Information on Him and his Nephew represents the Outcome , or Power , of conflict in this story . <p> How is this the Outcome of the story , rather than the Potential ? <h> Time to Discuss Time <p> Contrary to what many think , time is not strictly a progression of cause to effect . The idea that this happens , then that happens , and then finally that happens is a very linear way of looking at the universe . From another point-of-view , it all happens at once . What will be was , and what is will be . <p> Unfortunately the telling of a story is a linear process . We show one scene then move onto the next and then the next . Novels have sentences , movies have scenes . We ca n't deliver the storyform holistically so we approximate it by delivering the Outcome with the Setup . <p> When it comes to understanding PRCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must find a way to become comfortable with seeing space and time all at once . This is not something many are used to doing . For predominantly linear thinkers this may be even more difficult , perhaps impossible ; for the more holistically inclined the response may be Well , duh , yeah ... <p> The holistically inclined already see the Outcome of this dramatic circuit from the beginning . The relationship between other dramatic potentials and this first Signpost of Learning telegraph this final stage.1 Linear thinkers often attribute this to " intuition " as they do n't understand how one could arrive at a conclusion before proceeding from beginning to end . They do n't get how you can write a narrative without thinking cause and effect in every instance . <p> But you can . <p> The great things is " Dramatica offers linear thinkers a chance to see the other side . <h> Developing the Potential and Completing the Circuit <p> The Outcome of the dramatic circuit does n't mean what happens in the end of the story , but rather the stage at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next stage , the Revelation , is the reveal of the Potential in this circuit . <p> Continuing on with our story ... <p> In an effort to help his uncle , the nephew absconds with the secrets . Unfortunately , not only does he make off with the tech , he also ends up setting it off--creating a wormhole in the universe that transports him into the heart of the NSA 's new neural network for spying on the world . The confusion surrounding this event and Misunderstanding that occurs with the introduction of this bug in the system--both in the neural network and within the Chinese spy network--represents the Potential for conflict in the story . The imbalance between the forces at work that seek resolution finds genesis in this section . <p> How weird is that ? We started with the Outcome of the circuit , and now we move back to the Potential , or genesis of the circuit . Same events , but the story feels somewhat stranger <p> Outcome meets Potential and creates the Current of our story . The nephew works to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese and US spy agencies work to Permanently Extract the Bug from the Network ( Obtaining ) . Agents from both sides delete each other as they work towards neutralizing the nephew . <p> The Current finds itself in the same position as the original story . And while the same exact things happen , by proceeding it with the Outcome and Potential of the circuit is putting the young boy on a different path . <p> The only thing left to cover is the Resistance of this circuit . <h> Completing the Circuit <p> Funny to consider the Resistance of our circuit at the end of our story , but one does n't argue with Dramatica when it comes to matters of time and space . <p> We know the Power of dealing with these thematic considerations finds us in Gathering Information . And we know the Potential finds its genesis in Misunderstandings . And the Current finds tangible existence in Extraction and Deletion . But where is the Resistance in the circuit ? <p> Everyone knows you ca n't have Power without Resistance . <p> Running from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have identified an intruder is the Resistance ( the Doing ) to that Potential .

The NSA could have prevented his untimely end , but chose not too--preferring instead to avoid any conflict and make it possible for the boy to continue running for his life . And continue to engage the wormhole device . And continue to expose vulnerabilities in their system and in the Chinese spy network . <p> The professor 's invention lies unfinished . <p> And the world stays the same . <h> The Circuit Now Complete <p> The story had to end in failure because of the order in which the storyform progressed through PRCO . That Resistance of Doing increased the Potential of Misunderstanding and Confusion . Continuing the confusion . Not resolving it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Can you feel the dramatic difference in how this story feels compared to the last ?

That was always going to be the end all of the meaning of this storyform . That 's why you already know where the story will end up intuitively , even after the first Act . Your mind 's ability to holistically appreciate the process of Problem solving locked in the code of a complete narrative gave you that answer even before you read the whole thing . That feeling of dread for the boy and his uncle that you felt towards the beginning of the 2nd act ? That 's the storyform informing you that it 's not going to end well for them . <h> More to the Story <p> With stealing initiating the inequity and the Setup focusing on the last stage of the dramatic circuit , the stoyform hardwired the failure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

By aligning the 1234 order with PRCO we tell a certain kind of story .

The storyform is the progression and component relationship of the argument in both space and time . The Scene level , then , is the smallest resolution possible in formulating that argument--without losing sight of the top . <p> Acts find themselves in the Type level and are identified by the Signposts . Sequences show up in the Variation level and find homes in the various thematic Issues . Scenes reveal themselves at the Element level and work a path through semantic items typically reserved for Problems , Solutions , Symptoms , and Responses . <p> The same meaningful order and relationship that exists at the Type level within the Signposts ( found in the Plot Progression window ) and at the Variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report ) is also found at the Scene level . <p> We just ca n't see it . <p> And I mean literally , not figuratively . <p> The Dramatica application fails to provide an accurate assessment of the order and relationship between items at the Scene level . <p> We can only guess . <h> Resolution and Meaning <p> At this time it also becomes necessary to point out that at this level , the order and relationship loses importance in the conveying of the meaning wrapped up in the storyform . Running a Signpost 3 before Signpost 2 has a significantly greater impact on the meaning of a storyform than misconstruing a 3rd Scene of Control for a 2nd Scene of Avoid . The first will result in a demonstrably recognizable difference in the emotional meaning of a story ; the second will be attributed to a loss of signal due to noise . <p> Looking at a wooden table , a change in the texture of the grain will still convey to the observer a wooden table .

Perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRCO <p> In addition to the order of Signposts found within the Plot Progression window , each Signpost receives a marker of Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome .

@@119273955 @8273955/ 209543 @qwx1069543 <h> Thoughts on Story Structure <p> I 've only tried one screenwriting plotting program . Dramatica attempts to formalize the process by which a crafty screenwriter creates a story . It boils down story structure to a " branching tree " of thirty-two thousand possible " storyforms " . By answering questions like " Does the Main Character succeed or fail ? " And " Is this a good thing or a bad thing ? " you settle on one storyform . It is supposed to take about a week to learn how to use Dramatica . I have no idea if Dramatica is worth the money , but the company has some happy reviews on their website . If you have trouble figuring out why your stories come out wrong , or just have trouble creating story structure , Dramatica or something similar might help . <p> Hahahahahahahaha . <p> A week and twenty years maybe . And even then you might end up completely borking your initial analysis of a great movie like Ex Machina . Dramatica is more than worth the money--if for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater understanding of story . <p> The Dramatica theory of story offers Authors a rare opportunity to look at their story from an objective point-of-view " from the perspective of what their story means , rather than how their story plays out . <p> Acts , Sequences , and Scenes exist in the Storytelling Domain . They help frame and illustrate meaning . Unfortunately , the infinite variety in which they can be appreciated and observed makes them deficient for an objective framework of story . <p> Keep Acts , Sequences , and Scenes for those paradigms and models of story that look at presentation and Audience Reception . But when it comes to Dramatica , the theory should likely pivot to ensure greater understanding of Dramatica 's unique story points and structure . <p> The Dramatica concept of the Throughline Issue used to be called Range with the first version of the theory back in 1994 . As Sequences travel through the Variation level of the model " where the Issues of a Throughline are found " why not use the original terminology to break free from ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrenched in that paradigm and their own preconceptions about what a sequence is to use both systems without cross-interference . <p> As far as Scenes go " as we develop an understanding of how Dramatica Scene Construction works , it becomes apparent that the idea of an actual " scene " varies depending on when you get into the Dramatic Unit ( quad ) and when you get out . Again , instead of relying on the physical concept of " the scene " to communicate the smallest meaningful part of Dramatica , why not start introducing Authors to this idea of a complete Dramatic Unit ? <p> They can still start their " scenes " late into the unit and can , of course , leave whenever they want . The important part is that Authors and producers and directors alike begin to understand the PRCO , SRCA , TKAD , and PASS of a Dramatic Unit . Combining that knowledge with whatever techniques they mastered on the other side of communicating a story will result in an effective and efficient storyteller . <p> It 's important to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about stories . Screenplays start on page one and go until they are finished , about 110 pages . Stories start when an inequity becomes problematic and ends when things are put back into balance . Stories are not confined to a physical form , they are a mental construct . <p> Which reminds me . Dramatica needs to pivot to different terminology when it comes to Scenes , Sequences , and Acts . <p> That 's a fancy way of saying that Snyder ( et al. ) are talking about how a story is laid out . <p> The key is to always think of Author 's Intent . When it comes to Dramatica " and looking at Scenes , Sequences , and Acts through that lens " the " message " or storyform the Author intends on communicating is the primary object of focus . <p> So think of the Potential of the circuit as the source of inequity for that dramatic movement as far as the Author is concerned . You 're not looking at where the Scene starts , but rather where the Author believes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose " it 's a matter of where the emphasis is placed . <p> In A Separation the Potential for conflict lies within Nader 's strict convictions . Remove his obstinate I 'm always right no matter what attitude and there is no real conflict . No back and forth arguing . No problem with Simin leaving . And the judge could go on living his happy life without interruption . <p> It is clear from this scenes , and from many others , that the Author of A Separation intended to show Nader 's attitude as one of the primary sources of conflict within the story . This scene is a microcosm of that intent . <p> The Resistance of a dramatic circuit amplifies or diminishes that Potential . In A Separation that amplification arrives in the form of the judge essentially siding with Nader . Overwhelmed by the system , he takes the easy way out figuring everything will work itself out . <p> Why is Simin 's hope for a better life for her daughter not the Resistance to the Potential found in Nader ? It certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit of meaning constructed by the Author it neither amplifies nor diminishes that inequity . <p> This is where paradgims of scene construction that look simply at the wants and needs of characters fall short for many Authors . Butting one character 's wants against the wants of another ( A man wants a delicious taco , another wo n't let him have it ) can lead to a zero charge for that scene . They effectively cancel each other out . <p> Dramatica , on the other hand , works with the Author to communicate his or her intention . In A Separation , the Author states that matters get worse for those involved because of this laissez-faire attitude in Iran that everything will work itself out . There 's nothing wrong with Simin 's attitude or their arguing " the Potential forumlated within Nader 's convictions is amplified by the system . That is part of the message of purpose intended by the Author . <p> The Current of a dramatic circuit shows the play , or interaction , between Potential and Resistance . In A Separation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the posturing and positioning between husband and wife as they try to make themselves heard . <p> In effect , the Author writes the conflict that arises from the Potential meeting up against the Resistance . It is possible the Author imagined this conflict first , then worked backwards to determine the Potential " the source of that inequity " and the Resistance that engendered the conflict in the first place . <p> And finally , the Power of the dramatic circuit displays the result or outcome of the other three " and the potential for conflict to arise in later scenes . In A Separation this Power lies in Simin 's hope for a greater future for her daughter . That notion of misplaced potential that lies in her young child trapped in a country that diminishes her importance . <p> Rather than seeing this desire as the Potential that drives the scene , the Author decides to encode it as the eventual Outcome of all the awfulness that came before . <p> To summarize : <p> The Potential of a dramatic unit is where the Author sees the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be no reason for the scene . <p> The Resistance of a dramatic unit amplifies or diminishes the Potential . In short , what does the Author believe makes things worse ? <p> The Current of a dramatic unit is the interaction between Potential and Resistance , the escalation or descalation of dramatic conflict as seen by the Author . <p> The Outcome of the dramatic unit is where the Author believes the Power of the circuit lies and where a possible potential for the next Scene arises . <p> There is a sense from this scene that not everything will work out the way it should . The alignment of these events within the dramatic unit and the order in which they are presented is the reason for that feeling . The PRCO and SRCA of every dramatic unit is purposeful and adds to the Author 's message carried within the code of the storyform . <p> A complete perfectly structured scene consists of four Events . When using the Dramatica theory of story to analyze or create a scene , four modalities of Scene Construction exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mentality ) <p> PRCO ( Potential , Resistance , Current , Outcome ) <p> SRCA ( Setup , Revelation , Conflict , Aftermath ) <p> PASS ( Passive , Active , Structural , Storytelling ) <p> The first three modalities are applied to the four major Events of a complete Scene . Each Event gets one TKAD , one PRCO , and one SRCA . When the totality of the first three are exposed the scene feels complete both emotionally and logistically . <p> The last modality sets the mode by which the Author intends to illustrate the scene . In contrast to the first three , the Author does not apply a member of PASS to each of the four Events , but rather selects one to color the illustration of the first three modalities . <h> An Analysis of One of the Greats <p> In the first scene from A Separation , wife Simin wants to leave the country of Iran with her husband Nader and her daughter Termeh . Simin does not want her daughter to grow up within the current conditions of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll and must be cared for at all times . Nader 's determination to stay in Iran forces Simin to file for divorce . <p> This first scene is her application for that divorce . <p> Studying the scene we see four major Events : <p> Simin desires a better life for her daughter . <p> Nader refuses to consider . <p> Husband and wife argue with the judge as they plead their side <p> The judge refuses to decide in Simin 's favor . <p> First we will go through the first three modalities : <h> TKAD <p> Here we identify the source of conflict in each Event : <p> Situation : Simin and her daughter are women stuck in modern-day Iran . <p> Fixed Attitude : Nader 's confidence that his way is the only way is the focus of his bad attitude . <p> Activity : Simin and Nader argue their point of view--interrupting one another . <p> Mentality : The judge passively aggressively scolds the parents for bringing their argument to court . <p> Applying TKAD colors the Event by enriching it with meaning and purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Mentality--and gentle manipulation . <h> PRCO <p> Secondly , we identify the source of Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome of the dramatic unit in this scene . <p> Potential : Nader is absolutely dead set with his convictions . He has no doubt that his way is the way . <p> Resistance : The judge , overwhelmed with cases like this , prefers to take the easy way out . <p> Current : Husband and wife argue over what will most likely happen if the other wins . <p> Outcome : Simin sees great opportunity for her daughter elsewhere . <p> Again , the modalities enrich the Events by giving them greater dramatic impact . The judge leaving things open is n't the end , it 's the juice that runs through this scene--the possibility of things working out in the future . <h> SRCA <p> Thirdly , we decide the order . As the events unfold in a linear fashion ( without any fancy StoryWeaving time-shifting techniques ) identifying the order is as simple as jotting down the order in which the events were presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes her appeal . <p> Revelation : Nader explains why it 's a bad idea . <p> Conflict : Husband and wife plead their side <p> Aftermath : The judge refuses to decide in Simin 's favor . <p> Pretty cut and dried . Note that SRCA does not match with the PRCO . This happens as a byproduct of dynamic choices made by the Author . <h> PASS <p> Lastly , we color these three modalities with our means of illustrating the scene . This is a Passive Structural scene . While it passes on information concerning the storyform , it does not further the story along the way an Active Structural scene would . <p> This means we color the above with Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre . Note that Dramatica sees Genre differently " almost as a Perspective " for the Event in consideration . The Dramatica Genre quad sees for Perspectives of narrative : Entertainment , Comedy , Drama , and Information . <p> The Author passes along important , yet passive , structural information through these Events : <p> Character through Nader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision not to side with Simin . <p> Theme : through husband and wife arguing back and forth . This is a thematic statement repeated throughout the film : Individuals more interested in arguing their side , rather than coming to a synergistic conclusion . <p> Genre : through Simin 's situation we learn what it is like for women in Iran today and perhaps find out something we did n't know previously . We see her Situation in terms of Information . <p> The judge refuses to side with Simin ( Aftermath , Mentality , Resistance , Plot ) <p> With every modality accounted for , this scene in A Separation stands out as one of the greats . Storywise , it feels emotionally complete and logistically satisfying . In a fractal sense it works like a mini-story , a small dramatic unit that works as a part of a greater whole . <p> Although it has " flow " a circuit is really seen as a unit , comprised of these four parts . <p> This is why we can start with the Outcome , like we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carries a Message and then move on to the Potential . PRCO describes the relationship between the parts of that dramatic unit . <h> Active , Passive , Structural , Storytelling <p> There is a section at the end of the article that I skipped over when I began this discussion on Scene Structure with Dramatica . I skipped it because the section felt like one of those things that fit into the category of Underdeveloped Dramatica Theory , like the Lost Theory Book " fun to think about , not at all practical . After a weekend spent contemplating the deep thematic considerations of individual scenes , I wonder this section 's impact on the modalities of scenes . <p> The quad of items discussed in that section consists of Active , Passive , Structural , and Storytelling . Collectively they indicate the particular mode of illustration for the Events in a Scene . They indicate the teaching of the storyform . <h> Structural or Storytelling <p> Interesting that an Event could declare itself either Character , Plot , Theme , or Genre . And the other three Events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conveys the storyform itself . <p> Storytelling Scenes illustrate these four Events in terms of audience impact ( impacting the audience 's sense of their own Situation , affecting their Attitude , involving them in a vicarious Activity , or exploring the way their minds run by illuminating the Mentality ) . <p> I suppose Storytelling Scenes are the " fun " ones . The ones that thrill or chill or make us laugh . They perhaps have little to do with the structure or storyform at all . Remove them and the meaning of the story would remain the same--it just would n't be as much fun . <p> This is compelling because , as I started to consider various scenes for examples , there were several examples that I felt were n't robust enough .

Break the sentences down into something more visual . <p> Passive Storytelling Scenes illustrate the Events by impacting the Audience 's sense of Situation , Attitude , Activity , and way of Thinking <p> Active Structural Scenes use the four Events to move the story forward through Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre <p> Active Storytelling Scenes use the four Events to invoke changes in the nature of the Audience 's Situation , Attitude , Activity and Way of Thinking <h> Examples of Illustrating the Events <p> Many of the Death Star Attack scenes in Star Wars involve the Audience in a vicarious Activity . As did the Desert Chase sequence from Raiders of the Lost Arc . Passive or Active ? Active Storytelling . <p> The opening battle between husband and wife in A Separation ? Passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't push the story forward as they would with an Active Structural Scene . <p> The scene where Inigo Montoya stands up to the six-finger man in The Princess Bride ? Active Structural . Character , Plot , Theme , and Genre pushing the story forward . <p> The deli scene in When Harry Met Sally where Meg Ryan proves to Billy Crystal that women can fake anything ? Passive Storytelling meant to affect the Audience 's prejudiced Attitudes towards the other sex . <h> The Fourth Modality <p> After working through these items , this section is more important than I originally gave it credit . And I 'm pretty sure it replaces my idea of Proactive , Reactive , Defensive , and Inactive as the fourth modality . I was thinking Active and Passive when I developed those , but ignored Structural and Storytelling as I did n't find them pertinent . <p> Not anymore . <p> This quad illustrates TKAD and determines the force of Energy behind it . If the storyform " or TKAD " delivers the Understanding to the Audience , then PASS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storyform to an Audience . The Learning to the storyform 's Understanding . <p> What if we were to shift the sequence of PRCO at the Act level ? Instead of following the usual--and perhaps , predictable--pattern of 1234 ( or SRCA ) , what if we aligned the dramatic circuit to 4132 ? What would that do to the story ? More importantly , what would it feel like ? <p> Take our story from before , of the professor and the nephew and their struggle against the spy agencies of the world to bring a life-changing invention into existence . Thanks to the ingenuity of both , they succeeded and saved the world . <p> Let 's tell a different story . Same players , same potentials , same major plot events--but this time , let 's alter the order of the Plot Progression in the Overall Story : <p> Signpost 1 : Learning <p> Signpost 2 : Understanding <p> Signpost 3 : Obtaining <p> Signpost 4 : Doing <p> Already , it feels strange to think of our story in this order . The Learning used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning and now we conclude with Doing . What 's that going to be like ? <h> SRCA is NOT Storyweaving <p> Note that our markers for Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome remain the same : <p> Signpost 1 : Learning is still the Outcome <p> Signpost 2 : Understanding is still the Potential <p> Signpost 3 : Obtaining is still the Current <p> Signpost 4 : Doing is still the Resistance <p> As mentioned before , changing the order like this is not akin to time-shifting Storyweaving techniques found in films like Memento or Pulp Fiction . We can change the order in which the events from our first story are revealed to the Audience and the story will carry the same meaning . Changing the order of PRCO though--and thus , how the components relate to each other--will have a significant impact on the meaning of our story . <p> Let me show you . <h> The Beginning of a Different Story <p> An English professor screws over Chinese Nationalists by trading bogus inside information for access to secret technological hardware . The stealing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge for being duped and the Professor wants to use the secrets to invent a device to change the world . Tracking the Professor and Gathering Information on Him and his Nephew represents the Outcome , or Power , of conflict in this story . <p> How is this the Outcome of the story , rather than the Potential ? <h> Time to Discuss Time <p> Contrary to what many think , time is not strictly a progression of cause to effect . The idea that this happens , then that happens , and then finally that happens is a very linear way of looking at the universe . From another point-of-view , it all happens at once . What will be was , and what is will be . <p> Unfortunately the telling of a story is a linear process . We show one scene then move onto the next and then the next . Novels have sentences , movies have scenes . We ca n't deliver the storyform holistically so we approximate it by delivering the Outcome with the Setup . <p> When it comes to understanding PRCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must find a way to become comfortable with seeing space and time all at once . This is not something many are used to doing . For predominantly linear thinkers this may be even more difficult , perhaps impossible ; for the more holistically inclined the response may be Well , duh , yeah ... <p> The holistically inclined already see the Outcome of this dramatic circuit from the beginning . The relationship between other dramatic potentials and this first Signpost of Learning telegraph this final stage.1 Linear thinkers often attribute this to " intuition " as they do n't understand how one could arrive at a conclusion before proceeding from beginning to end . They do n't get how you can write a narrative without thinking cause and effect in every instance . <p> But you can . <p> The great things is " Dramatica offers linear thinkers a chance to see the other side . <h> Developing the Potential and Completing the Circuit <p> The Outcome of the dramatic circuit does n't mean what happens in the end of the story , but rather the stage at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next stage , the Revelation , is the reveal of the Potential in this circuit . <p> Continuing on with our story ... <p> In an effort to help his uncle , the nephew absconds with the secrets . Unfortunately , not only does he make off with the tech , he also ends up setting it off--creating a wormhole in the universe that transports him into the heart of the NSA 's new neural network for spying on the world . The confusion surrounding this event and Misunderstanding that occurs with the introduction of this bug in the system--both in the neural network and within the Chinese spy network--represents the Potential for conflict in the story . The imbalance between the forces at work that seek resolution finds genesis in this section . <p> How weird is that ? We started with the Outcome of the circuit , and now we move back to the Potential , or genesis of the circuit . Same events , but the story feels somewhat stranger <p> Outcome meets Potential and creates the Current of our story . The nephew works to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese and US spy agencies work to Permanently Extract the Bug from the Network ( Obtaining ) . Agents from both sides delete each other as they work towards neutralizing the nephew . <p> The Current finds itself in the same position as the original story . And while the same exact things happen , by proceeding it with the Outcome and Potential of the circuit is putting the young boy on a different path . <p> The only thing left to cover is the Resistance of this circuit . <h> Completing the Circuit <p> Funny to consider the Resistance of our circuit at the end of our story , but one does n't argue with Dramatica when it comes to matters of time and space . <p> We know the Power of dealing with these thematic considerations finds us in Gathering Information . And we know the Potential finds its genesis in Misunderstandings . And the Current finds tangible existence in Extraction and Deletion . But where is the Resistance in the circuit ? <p> Everyone knows you ca n't have Power without Resistance . <p> Running from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have identified an intruder is the Resistance ( the Doing ) to that Potential . Especially since returning to the professor would drag attention to the old man and destroy any chance of his invention coming to fruition . <p> And it does . <p> The nephew makes it out of the network and back to reality alive only to witness the professor 's murder at the hands of the Chinese Nationalists . The NSA could have prevented his untimely end , but chose not too--preferring instead to avoid any conflict and make it possible for the boy to continue running for his life . And continue to engage the wormhole device . And continue to expose vulnerabilities in their system and in the Chinese spy network . <p> The professor 's invention lies unfinished . <p> And the world stays the same . <h> The Circuit Now Complete <p> The story had to end in failure because of the order in which the storyform progressed through PRCO . That Resistance of Doing increased the Potential of Misunderstanding and Confusion . Continuing the confusion . Not resolving it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Can you feel the dramatic difference in how this story feels compared to the last ? That has everything to do with Dramatica 's ability to translate time and space into a singular meaning . That has everything to do with the Storyform . <p> That Power of Gathering Information ? That was always going to be the end all of the meaning of this storyform . That 's why you already know where the story will end up intuitively , even after the first Act . Your mind 's ability to holistically appreciate the process of Problem solving locked in the code of a complete narrative gave you that answer even before you read the whole thing . That feeling of dread for the boy and his uncle that you felt towards the beginning of the 2nd act ? That 's the storyform informing you that it 's not going to end well for them . <h> More to the Story <p> With stealing initiating the inequity and the Setup focusing on the last stage of the dramatic circuit , the stoyform hardwired the failure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PRCO is Space . SRCA is Time . Combine the two and you create a holographic image of Author 's intent . <p> The Dramatica model of story is a fractal model from top to bottom , from Act to Scene . Tomorrow we will look at how the combination of PRCO and SRCA works at the Scene level . Hint : it 's the same as described in the Act level above . <p> Yes , I wove other Story Appreciations into this example apart from the first Signpost of the Overall Story . ? ? <p> From this we can identify the SRCA , or 1234 , of the Throughline , but we ca n't appreciate PRCO . As a reminder the SRCA reflects the Setup , Revelation , Conflict , and Aftermath of a quad . <p> Let 's imagine for a second that it follows the typical Z pattern through a quad . <p> Signpost 1 : Understanding would be the Potential <p> Signpost 2 : Doing would be the Resistance <p> Signpost 3 : Obtaining would be the Current <p> Signpost 4 : Learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story like this : <p> An English professor screws over Chinese Nationalists by trading bogus inside information for access to secret technological hardware . This Misunderstanding manufactured by the Professor is the inequity of the story . The imbalance between forces is the source of Potential for conflict in the story : the Nationalists want revenge for being duped and the Professor wants to use the secrets to invent a device to change the world . <p> This would be an extremely boring and mundane cat-and-mouse tale if it were n't for the Professor 's nephew who shows up and accidentally absconds with the secrets . In fact , he not only makes off with the tech , he ends up setting it off--creating a wormhole in the universe that transports him into the heart of the NSA 's new neural network for spying on the world . Running from the Chinese Nationalists already in the network and the NSA agents who have identified an intruder is the Resistance ( the Doing ) to that initial Potential . Especially since returning to the professor would drag attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fruition . <p> Potential meets Resistance and creates the Current of our story . The nephew works to get a message of warning to the professor while the Chinese and US spy agencies work to Permanently Extract the Bug from the Network ( Obtaining ) . Agents from both sides delete each other as they work towards neutralizing the nephew . <p> The only thing left to cover is the Outcome of this circuit . <p> The nephew makes it out of the network and back to reality alive . Unaware of the results of his attempt to communicate to the professor , the boy races back home only to witness the professor 's murder at the hands of the Chinese Nationalists . They gave the boy his access back into the real world , avoiding conflict in order to Track the Boy and Locate the Whereabouts of the Professor ( Learning ) . But the Chinese were n't the only ones following the boy 's every move . The NSA arrives and terminates the Chinese agents as well . In doing so , the Americans reveal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The boy beams as the professor rises to his feet revealing a bulletproof vest beneath his clothing : he knew all along what was going to happen thanks to the boy and prepared for the occasion . And what 's more ... the professor had time to hide away his invention from the prying eyes of the NSA . <p> The professor changes the world with his invention . <h> Order Carries Meaning <p> With the professor saving the world , we complete the dramatic circuit of our story . By aligning the 1234 order with PRCO we tell a certain kind of story . If we were to alter this story by changing 1234 to match say OPCR , then we would be telling a different kind of story . **The order of the progression of events through the storyform carries meaning . ** <p> Note that this is separate from any Storyweaving techniques applied to the storyform during the Storytelling process . Films like Memento , Pulp Fiction , and Remains of the Day may play with the order in which they reveal the storyform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the story . SRCA is not time-switching . <p> Tomorrow we will cover this difference in meaning and show how it relates back to the structure of a scene . <p> If every Scene of a narrative is to further the argument , then the same kind of logic we find in the upper levels of Acts and Sequences should exist way down below . The storyform is the progression and component relationship of the argument in both space and time . The Scene level , then , is the smallest resolution possible in formulating that argument--without losing sight of the top . <p> Acts find themselves in the Type level and are identified by the Signposts . Sequences show up in the Variation level and find homes in the various thematic Issues . Scenes reveal themselves at the Element level and work a path through semantic items typically reserved for Problems , Solutions , Symptoms , and Responses . <p> The same meaningful order and relationship that exists at the Type level within the Signposts ( found in the Plot Progression window ) and at the Variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report ) is also found at the Scene level . <p> We just ca n't see it . <p> And I mean literally , not figuratively . <p> The Dramatica application fails to provide an accurate assessment of the order and relationship between items at the Scene level . <p> We can only guess . <h> Resolution and Meaning <p> At this time it also becomes necessary to point out that at this level , the order and relationship loses importance in the conveying of the meaning wrapped up in the storyform . Running a Signpost 3 before Signpost 2 has a significantly greater impact on the meaning of a storyform than misconstruing a 3rd Scene of Control for a 2nd Scene of Avoid . The first will result in a demonstrably recognizable difference in the emotional meaning of a story ; the second will be attributed to a loss of signal due to noise . <p> Looking at a wooden table , a change in the texture of the grain will still convey to the observer a wooden table . It does n't suddenly become a chair . Perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRCO <p> In addition to the order of Signposts found within the Plot Progression window , each Signpost receives a marker of Potential , Resistance , Current , and Outcome . These are the essential components of the dramatic circuit found in Dramatica . Think of them as the Problem , Symptom , Response , and Solution for every quad . <p> The Problem arises with the introduction of an inequity and creates the Potential for dramatic conflict . <p> The Symptom represents Resistance to that inequity in the form of misconstrued focus . <p> The Response acts as the Current to the combined application of Potential and Resistance . <p> And finally , the Solution functions as the Power , or Outcome , of that dramatic circuit--the result of the first three interacting with each other . <p> Note that the Power of a dramatic circuit does not necessarily mean equity returns . In fact , if caught in the midst of a larger argument , the retention of greater Potential in subsequent moments is the Outcome 's primary function . In other words , try not to zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , as with events at the Scene level the application fails to provide the identification of PRCO at the Signpost/Type level . <p> Theoretically , though , it is still there . <p> Tomorrow we will take a look at this dramatic circuit in action and provide a foundation for understanding how PRCO works within a scene . <p> At least , it was a breakthrough for me . I 'm sure Chris and Melanie , the co-creators of Dramatica , felt it covered some familiar ground . ? ? <p> From time to time , bloggers give up and quit . Sadly , it seems as if the " Screenwriting Screenwriter " , an occasional Dramatica blogger--and one I linked to in the past with my article Dramatica : Mad Libs or Madly Accurate--is now defunct . <p> I hate seeing stuff like this disappear off the grid . <p> So now it wo n't : <p> From May 15 , 2011 , at 12:33pm : Another Dramatica post because , frankly , I like it .

I ask the guys on the Convore discussion group for help , and they are patient with my ignorance . And then I run it through again and again . And it never works . I can get one throughline right , but the others never fit . <p> This is what 's maddening about Dramatica sometimes . You get your main storyline worked out exactly the way you want , and Dramatica tells you " okay , so your main character 's problem should have something to do with Perception vs . Actuality " .

The Underpants Gnomes of stories . <p> It occurred to me that I do n't even really have a clear sense of the what the story 's central problem is . I was getting ready to throw Dramatica aside and start writing this thing , and I do n't even know what the story 's about . It would have been a horrendous waste of effort . <p> And that is the reason why my Dramatica experiments were not working . If I 'm getting the very first question wrong--the Story Problem--how can I possibly expect it to help me with the answers that follow ? I need to really stop and think about these answers , not just throw something in that sort of feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people try out Dramatica briefly , get frustrated just as I have , and then discard it forever .

The truth is , like the Crucial Element , the Nature of a Story is one of those story points that is only important in so much as it informs the Author as to what kind of a story they are telling . You do n't  need to know it to write a good story or to make sure you do n't  have any story holes , but it is an interesting way to appreciate the kind of story you are telling . <h> Integrating with the Dramatic Circuit <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding weeks you will see a correlation between their structural concepts and the actual dramatic circuit that exists within a narrative : <p> Reach defines the Potential of the circuit to connect <p> Essence defines the Resistance of the circuit <p> Tendency defines the Current within the circuitry <p> This leaves one essential component left : the Power , or Outcome of the circuit . <p> Strange that one finds Essence as the Resistance of the circuitry , rather than Tendency . After all , we defined Tendency as maintaining the Resistance or Flow through a circuit . But if you think of it more as the speed or current of dramatic electrons through a story as measured by the relative resistance or flow , you will find Current a more accurate assignation . Essence , on the other hand , showcases the tension built up by the possible resistance facing the storys characters . <p> Thinking of these Audience Appreciations as components of an electric current explains my own personal resistance or rather , ambivalence , towards the appreciation of Nature : it merely describes the Outcome or end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother spending time on the relative aftermath of a dramatic circuit , when the bulk of writing deals with the formation and flow through the circuit ? <h> The Main Characters Resolve <p> As with the other Audience Appreciations , Story Nature consists of two story points : the Main Character Resolve and the Story Outcome . The first manages the " arc " of the central character of a narrative , while the second deals with the resolution of the storys efforts . <p> The " character arc " of a Main Character consists of a combination of how that central character develops over time and the status of their world paradigm at the end of the story . As with light in the physical world , character arc can be described as both a wave ( process ) or a particle ( state ) . The first part describes the process of the arc , the second keys us in on the state of the arc . Both define What Character Arc Really Means . <p> In Dramatica , the process of the arc finds itself within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds a home within the Main Character Resolve . <p> Comparing the state of the Main Characters world paradigm at the end of a story with how they began the narrative , an Author determines either a Changed Resolve or a Steadfast Resolve . Does the Main Character see the world differently from when they began a story ? If so , then their Resolve Changed ; if not , their Resolve remained Steadfast . <p> Luke Skywalker , Neo , Sarah Connor , Michael Corleone , William Munny , and Terry Malloy alter the way they see the world and identify as Changed characters . William Wallace , Shrek , Rocky , Captain Kirk , Marty McFly , Erin Brockovich , and Salieri remain true to their personal beliefs and identify as Steadfast characters . <h> The Story Outcome <p> While every complete story contains an emotional aspect to its ending , a logical aspect exists in parallel . Concerned more with the relative nature of satisfaction or disatisfaction , this story point informs the Audience whether the efforts to achieve the storys Goal ended in Success or Failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the overall weight of satisfaction will be felt on one side or the other . <p> Ted Kramer ( Dustin Hoffman ) secured custody of his child in Kramer vs . Kramer . Josh ( Tom Hanks ) made it back home in big . Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ) made it out of Shawshank . Gary and Lisa defeated the terrorists in Team America : World Police . Vincent ( Jamie Foxx ) stopped the assassin from creating further Collateral . And Marlin found Nemo . Each and every one of these stories ended in Success . <p> Rocky lost . Gordie and Chris did n't  get credit for finding the dead body in Stand By Me . Ennis and Jack couldnt change cultural conditioning in Brokeback Mountain . Tom Robinson was found guilty of a crime he did n't  commit in To Kill a Mockingbird . And Charlie Babbitt ( Tom Cruise ) gave up his half of the inheritance . Each and every one of these stories ended in Failure . <h> The Difference Between a Dilemma and a Work <p> Combine the Main Characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts to resolve the storys central problem and you define what Dramatica refers to as the Nature of a story . Some stories focus on what this appreciation sees as a Dilemma , while others focus on the Work . Some stories are Actual Dilemmas while others require Actual Work . Other stories are only Apparently Dilemmas and some are only Apparently Work stories . <p> The problem with this Audience Appreciation , and the point that was made in last years article , is the idea of singling out Main Characters with a Change Resolve as the only ones facing a Dilemma . <p> The way Dramatica combines the Main Character Resolve with the Story Outcome to define Story Nature results in this pattern : <p> Stories with a Changed MC are considered Dilemmas <p> Stories with a Steadfast MC are considered Works <p> Stories that end in Success are Actual Dilemmas or Actual Works <p> Stories that end in Failure are only Apparently Dilemmas or Apparently Works <p> Yet , Steadfast characters face Dilemmas as often as Changed characters . William Wallace ( Mel Gibson ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or screaming freeeeeddoooommmmmmm ! a true dilemma if ever there was one . Leonard Shelby ( Guy Pearce ) in Memento had to decide whether to trust John G. or shoot him in the back of the head . Christian ( Ewan McGregor ) in Moulin Rouge ! had to decide whether or not to turn around starting singing out Your Song for all to hear . Many Steadfast stories place Main Characters in Leap-of-Faith situations where they face the same kind of dilemma as their Changed couterparts " stay the course or adapt . <p> So why does Dramatica confine the Dilemma to only the Changed Main Character ? <p> Could it be that once again Chris and Melanie , the co-creators of the Dramatica theory of story , came up short when it came to defining the Nature of a story ? As with the twin story points of Tendency or Essence , perhaps new or more refined terminology could more accurately describe this Audience Appreciation . <h> A Measure of Regret <p> Recently , a student of ours brought up some interesting thoughts in regards to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he coined the term " Story Satisfaction " to describe this combination of story points : <p> The MC/Audience either regrets their behavior to change or not based on the success of the goal . For example , in a Change story , the character/audience is satisfied by the efforts of the MC if and only if the outcome is success . In a way , you can combine this with personal and universal tragedies to see that whether those characters change their point of view or not , they will not be satisfied . And , in fact if they do change their POV , there is even more regret . So , it is like a way to further measure tragedy or triumph . In other words , is n't it more tragic if the MC is change , failure , bad , than just a failure-bad ? And , is n't this because the change is regrettable ? <p> Regret is an interesting alternative to Work or Dilemma and worth considering when combining Resolve and Outcome . I imagine Contentment the counterpoint . And Regret and Contentment can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dramatic circuit . <p> Unfortunately , upon further examination this idea of " story satisfaction " fails to play out . <p> Looking at Resolve and Outcome together , if one changes and the story results in failure , do they regret not staying the course ? Sure , that makes sense . But then again if one remains Steadfast and the story results in failure , do they not also regret staying the course ? Christian from Moulin Rouge ! certainly regrets what happened . Leonard does n't  , but he s crazy ( and his staying the course actually resulted in Success ) . But I can definitely tell you that Ennis Del Mar ( Heath Ledger ) from Brokeback Mountain regrets his decision to stay away from Jack . <p> Regret seems to be more a function of the Story Outcome : Success or Failure , rather than any particular combination of Resolve and Outcome . Stories that end in Failure are regrettable while those that end in Success bring contentment . As terminology , they function about as well as Actual and Apparent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Not all Failure stories are seen as regrettable . Charlie Babbit ( Tom Cruise ) in Rain Man certainly does not regret time spent with his brother . Detective Huxley ( Guy Pearce ) does n't  regret the decisions he made in L.A. Confidential . Neither does Andy Sachs ( Anne Hathaway ) in The Devil Wears Prada . <p> In addition , thinking in subjective terms of regret and contentment opens one up to the possibilty of assuming that the presence of one storyform naturally argues against the alternative . <h> A Measure of What is There , Not What Isnt <p> The reasoning involved in this idea of " story satisfaction " " that a change in approach that leads to failure makes the alternative argument that remaining steadfast would have led to success " is false reasoning . Sometimes remaining true would lead to success , but not all the time . An argument made against something does not simultaneously argue for the alternative . <p> If Dobbs ( Humphrey Bogart ) in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre had remained driven by rational thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up dead and without the Gold ? Quite possibly . Likewise with Hamlet " if he had continued to pine on and on about whether to be or not to be would the memory of his father live on ? There you might have an argument , but one could just as easily argue that Claudius would have run him through after the ninth-thousandth time the kid gave in to his " pale cast of thought . " <p> The storyform argues its collection of thematic story points from a unique set of circumstancesit does not argue against or for another storyform . Just like the absence of a Timelock does not necessarily guarantee the presence of an Optionlock , the notion that a Changed paradigm leads to Tragedy does not guarantee that remaining Steadfast would have resulted in a Triumph . <p> On the flip side , is n't a Steadfast-success-good , more triumphant than a change-success-good because of the amount of work it takes to achieve that purity of goodness ? Thinking of the philosophers in the middle ages attributing all those great steadfast qualities to God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here we run into the problem with making subjective assumptions about objective story points . <h> The Dramatica Way to Look at Story <p> Dramatica , on the other hand , takes an objective look at story . Looking at narrative from the Authors point-of-view , it asks What is it you want to say with your story ? Note the difference in mindset hereinstead of dealing with experience , Dramatica deals with process . It deals with the ingredients of story . <p> What you want to say with your story has nothing to do with How do you want the audience to interpret what it is you want to say ? Authors can predict what their story will say , but they can never know the true meaning of their work . They can never understand the true Outcome of their endeavors . <p> In other words " Writers can never fully understand the Nature of their story . <h> The True Nature of a Dramatic Circuit <p> Turns out Chris and Melanie were spot on in their definition of this Audience Appreciation . The Dramatica theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Character remains steadfast , he spends the entire story doing work to try and solve the problemWhen the Main Character changes , he has come to believe that he is the real cause of the problem . This is called a Dilemma Story because the Main Character spends the story wrestling with an internal dilemma . <p> By Dilemma Chris and Melanie were referring to the structure of the entire story " the Power of the entire circuitNOT simply the culimination moment : <p> A story can be appreciated as a structure in which the beginning , middle , and end can all be seen at the same time . <p> Another key aspect of the Dramatica theory of story that many forget1 is the idea that both space and time coexist within the storyform . Work and Dilemma refer to the dramatic circuit as a whole , not simply the ending . This idea I had that the Nature simply referred to the endpoint of the circuit was an error in judgment based on inaccurate linear thinking . <p> Chris and Melanie were defining the Holistic nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire circuit " beginning , middle , and end . Power is seen throughout a circuit as the relationships between the components , not simply something spit out at the end of a line . <p> With this in mind , it becomes clear the difference between Dilemma and Work , Apparent and Actualthis story point defines the Nature of the storymind itself . <h> An Actual Dilemma <p> With an Actual Dilemma story we see Main Characters who Changed their Resolves and found Success in the Overall Story : <p> Ted Kramer started thinking of someone other than himself in Kramer vs . Kramer and found his son waiting for him at the other end . Chris Kyle chooses family over the military in American Sniper and finds he can help even more soldiers through his work rehabilitating disabled veterans . With Inside Out , Joy starts to give the other emotions a chance to run things in Rileys head and finds it easier to integrate into a new situation . <p> Overall these stories showcase Main Characters who believed themselves part of the problem , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Contrast that with these stories where a Change in Resolve ended in Failure : <p> Lester started seeing things for what they really wereand ended up dead because of it in American Beauty . Jules decided to start being supportive instead of speaking out against her best friends wedding and lost the chance at marrying her best friend in My Best Friends Wedding . And Dr. Arroways switch to seeing the infinite possibilities in the Universe rather than what most likely exists out there kept everyone from finding out whether they are truly alone or not . <p> These Main Characters believed themselves part of the problem , and by changing ended up bringing failure to the efforts to resolve the storys central problem . <h> An Actual Work <p> Switching to the Steadfast Main Characters , we first focus on stories that actually required Work to Succeed : <p> Jason Bourne focus on staying hyper aware of everything around him helped him take down Treadstone in The Bourne Identity . Anna Khitrovas determination to stay the course helps her secure Tatianas baby while successfully fighting back against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signal fire was the only way off the island helped the boys stay alive until rescued in Lord of the Flies . <p> These Main Characters spend the bulk of their narratives doing work to try and solve the problem and find success at the end of it all . <h> An Apparent Work <p> And finally we look at those Steadfast Main Characters whose attempts to work the problem only brought about Failure : <p> Naders steadfast belief that he was never to blame for anything forced the dissolution of his marriage in A Separation . Lukes refusal to stop fighting the good fight ends his life and the hopes of his brothers-in-chains in Cool Hand Luke . Butchs steadfast confidence in his his plans to get of anything finds himself and Sundance charging out in a blaze of glory in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid . <p> Unlike the previous set of Steadfast Main Characters , these characters attempts to do work to try and solve their problems were only apparently the appropriate thing to do at the time . <p> The Nature of the stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 126 stories <p> Actual Works - 89 stories <p> Apparent Dilemmas - 66 stories <p> Apparent Works - 27 stories <p> Apparently , not many want to be told or teach that sticking to your guns results in failure . The difference between an actual problem and an apparent problem is staggering : 215 to 93 . Whether cultural bias or biological imperative , the message is clear . The overwhelming majority of narratives trend towards a focus on solving actual problems , not apparent problems . <h> The Power of a Dramatic Circuit <p> Look at any quad of elements within the Dramatica Table of Story Elements and you will always find one that does n't  quite fit in . Past , Present , and Future sit alongside Progress . Memories , Innermost Desires , and Contemplations share space with Impulsive Responses . <p> And now Reach , Essence , and Tendency have Nature . <p> When evaluating the power of an electric circuit one does n't  simply look to the end , one must look at the operation of the entire thing all at once . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story and their personal predicaments , you lose sight of the overall meaning and intent of the narrative . You lose sight of what it was you were trying to say . <p> The original intent of this series on Audience Appreciations was to pierce the veil between Author and Audience . To somehow find a new approach to using Dramatica to write our stories from the Audiences point-of-view . By diving into this weird and somehow off-beat take on Dramaticas story points we actually found something far more excitinga greater understanding of the holistic nature of narrative . <h> A Relationship Between Story Elements <p> Effective story structure looks at story in its entirety . It does not look at a narrative as a linear progression of events asking " dramatic questions " and building up tension from one sequence to the next .
